<h2>JOHN LA FARGE<br />

By Russell Sturgis</h2>

<p class="caption">A Study.</p>
</div>

<p>The artist of four
hundred years
ago, or of any
great time for individual
effort as opposed
to the associated
and unrecorded
work of more primitive
times, was a
many-sided man.
He was probably a
traveller, if not a
monk; he was almost
certainly a man of
adventure; a man of
thought, whether
monk or layman.
The artist did not
travel far; but he encountered
more personal
risk between
Florence and Naples
than our contemporary
does in voyaging
to the Isles of Summer;
he encountered
in Sicily, in Hungary,
or in Spain a people
as remote from him as
the Japanese are from us; and he had still
Constantinople and Cairo to visit, places
more distant and as inaccessible to him as
Thibet or Kafiristan in the nineteenth century.
The old artist was something of a
scholar, too, with a habit of study and
meditation, if not master of many books.
And, moreover, the old artist was very
much in love with his work and loved to
play with it as well as to work in it; so
that he touched many materials, handled
many processes, and used many methods of
artistic utterance. Again it is worth noting
that no one had discovered, in 1499,
that architecture was an art to be practised
without regard to the other manifestations
of the artistic spirit; nor yet that
the sculptor and the painter were two
workmen whose art was to be practised
apart from and independent of building or
other industrial occupation.</p>

<p class="caption">Study for Browning's "Men and Women."</p>
</div>

<p>All these things have been so much
changed of late that it is noticeable in
Mr. La Farge's life that he should be, in
many ways, like a painter of old time, that
is, traveller, reader, collector and student;
colorist and decorator; painter in large
and in little. He has been a working artist
for forty years, and has done many things.
He has made many book illustrations
which have been published and many
which have never been given to the world.
The illustrations to Browning's book,
"Men and Women," as it was originally
published in 1855, are among these; and
there are reproduced here the full-page
design for the beginning of <i>Protus</i> and
also two studies for <i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The little children round him in a row</p>
<p>Of admiration, half for his beard and half</p>
<p>For that white anger of his victim's son.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>This was early work. The illustration
to <i>Misconceptions</i> is as mystical as that for
<i>Protus</i>; and that which concludes <i>Bishop
Blougram's Apology</i> is as realistic as these
studies of children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i-012" id="i-012"></a>
<img src="images/i-012.jpg" width="262" height="489" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Study for Browning's "Men and Women."</p>
</div>

<p>Then, still of his early days, are to be
considered the faithful little studies and
close-to-nature drawings which served as
a foundation for a structure of knowledge
which was to pile itself high enough. <i>Sic
itur ad astra</i>; and with a different result
from the tower-building recorded in Genesis.
The reproduction given [<a href="#i-016">on page 9</a>]
is from a sketch-book of 1860; and the
work has been a careful drawing in black on
white, done in the flat country about Bayou
Têche. These are drawings <i>in values</i>, or
made for values; that is to say, the relative
force of darkness or of light is carefully
preserved. A certain green of the
trees may be lighter than the blue, still
water below, but is very much
darker than the same water
where it reflects the pale evening
sky; the reflection in the
water of those same trees is a
shade or two darker than the
mass of trees themselves; and
so on, forever. Of the same
epoch is this drawing of a beacon
[<a href="#i-017b">page 10</a>], a flaming cresset,
a signal light seen against a
night sky. These are warnings
to steamboats on the Mississippi
to avoid a shoal or to make a
landing. Other studies, those
of pure line and those of masses,
those of his youth and those of
his maturity, are scattered over
these pages.</p>

<p>He has produced also a very
great number of water-color
drawings, generally small, and
very commonly having for their
subjects pieces of foreground
detail, such as one or several
blossoms in a pool of water, or
a water-lily or two afloat on the
surface of a still pond. It might
almost be said that his water-colors
were generally of such detail
as this, except that the work
done during his journeys into
tropical and oriental lands has
resulted differently.</p>

<p>Again he has produced, during
those years of work, a few
large pictures painted in oil-color
or by a process which he
learned in his youth and in
which melted wax has a part;
though this is not the encaustic process
of antiquity or of modern revival. One
or two of these are portraits, several are
landscapes, several are studies of interesting
details which he wished to preserve
and which for some reason or other
had struck him as more easily rendered
on a large scale and in the more
solid material; and some are, to all appearance,
concepts for mural decoration&mdash;advance
studies for that which was to
be painted on a still larger scale, or in combination
with other parts of a large composition,
and finally to be fixed upon the
wall where it was to remain permanently.
Some, also, of the water-colors produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
in recent years are, though not
large in superficies, very large
in treatment. A glowing color
composition suggested by the
mountain country of Fiji, a
monochrome study of a river
landscape in Japan, may be as
grandiose in character and may
contain as much matter, both
in represented detail and in artistic
purpose, as an oil-painting
of four times the surface-measurement.
Some illustrations
given on another page of this
treatise may partly show the
qualities here suggested.</p>

</div>

<p>He has produced, also, a few
such mural paintings as those
whose intention is assumed in
the last paragraph. Of these,
much the largest is that which
covers the end wall of the
Church of the Ascension in
New York. There are others in
St. Thomas's Church and in the
Church of the Incarnation, both
in New York City; the interior
of Trinity Church in Boston was
painted by him with a series of
figure subjects, though the
chromatic treatment of this interior
does not include any large
single painting of great importance;
and of late years, two
lunettes in the Villard-Reid
house in New York and one in
the Walker Art Gallery at Bowdoin
College have been added
to this summary list. There is
reproduced here the last-named
picture [<a href="#i-024">page 17]</a>; a picture of fantastic
subject in the "literary" or narrative sense.
<i>Athens</i> is its given name; but it represents
Pallas making a drawing of the
lovely and unadorned genius of the open
country or wood, while the robed and
crowned impersonated City looks affectionately
at both the subject and the recording
goddess. To be classed under
the head of mural paintings also is the remarkable
composition of small pictures involved
in a large design with panels and
arabesques, which decorates the wooden
vaults of that gallery in Mr. Cornelius
Vanderbilt's house, which used to be called
the Water-Color Room, and which now,
since the alteration of the house and the
removal of this painted vault into the new
building, may be considered the gallery of
entrance for stately entertainments. To
a limited extent, the work of other painters
is associated with his own in the last-named
achievement, as also in Trinity
Church. In this, the work of the artist
comes very near to decoration pure and
simple. The reader is not to understand
that any sharp distinction is made here
between decoration and that painting
which is not so designated. It is to be
hoped that he, the reader, will see as he
reads that to deny this distinction is part
of the life-purpose of John La Farge; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
purpose which his critic is glad to recognize
and to second. It is merely with
reference to its placing&mdash;to its apparent
intended service&mdash;to its fixed location and
its consequent exclusion from the category
of "gallery pictures" or "easel pictures"
that the words decoration
and decorative are here
applied to certain paintings.
For throughout his
career this artist has
leaned strongly toward
the treatment of his expressional
and significant
painting in a decorative
way.</p>

<p>Decoration in the more
usual sense has been also
a large part of his work.
Thus, when in 1878 he
contracted with Mr. Cornelius
Vanderbilt for a
carved ceiling, it appeared
that his intentions
in the matter were those
which could have been
suggested only by a mind
full of the decorative idea.
"A carved ceiling" might
have been almost anything;
but this one was
an elaborate composition
of colored sculpture, or, if
you please, of polychromy
in relief; certainly
one of the most remarkable
undertakings of
the time. What seem to
be (for the true constructional
character of the
ceiling is not here guaranteed) what seem
to be the beams, the constructional part
of the ceiling, were of light-colored walnut.
The panels within were filled with
figures of armed warriors and of draped
women of about half life-size, and these
panels were framed by
rim within rim, moulding
within moulding, of elaborate
sculptured pattern.
All these sculptured patterns,
all these figures,
were invested with color
in a way which it is hard
to describe; for different
chosen woods, alloys of
metal of which some are
of Japanese origin,
opaque and colored glass,
ivory, mother-of-pearl,
and even coral are combined
to give delicately
tinted color and subtle
variety of surface to the
work. That ceiling has
been broken up; but
there has been great good
judgment shown in its rearrangement.
The panels of the ceiling are now
arranged so that they are
well lighted both by day
and by night, and show
admirably. Although the
original design has disappeared,
the separate panels,
each with its enclosing
mouldings and woodwork,
at least four by six
feet in superficies, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
well displayed. One of these panels is here
engraved [<a href="#i-013a">page 6</a>]. Here also is given
part of a decorative frieze in which castings
specially made of blue glass were used with
ivory and with carvings in solid <i>nacre</i>, in
combination with the carved walnut.</p>

<p>Similar work has been done by Mr. La
Farge in connection with his own paintings,
and sometimes where no paintings
were used. This use, on a large scale, of
rich material, rich in color, in surface and
in lustre, as a medium for sculpture, is almost
peculiar to this artist among modern
men. Others who have cared for color
in sculpture have played with it, rather,
in small objects of the cabinet; and this
remains true in a general way in spite of
a pleasant use of enamel in some French
work in bronze of a more important or,
at least, more pretentious character.</p>

</div>

<p>At a time not far removed from the undertaking
of the ceiling and the mantelpiece
above mentioned, a monument was
put up in the Newport Cemetery under
the direction of Mr. La Farge [<a href="#i-023">page 16</a>].
He associated with himself in this task the
sculptor, since so widely known, but then
a young man, Augustus St. Gaudens, who
had already worked with him on the
carved and colored ceiling. Every student
of architectural designs will be struck
by the informal character of this design:
the steps which are clearly not meant to
be ascended and which have an obvious
symbolic meaning; the horizontal cross
sunk in the table of the monument in such
a way that few persons can be so placed
as to see it favorably; the inscription
carved upon the butt or foot of that
cross; the apparently disproportionate
slenderness of the upright cross with its
thin cylindrical shaft; the placing of other
inscriptions on the body of the massive
base in which no specially arranged panels
or medallions have been prepared for
them; and, most of all, the treatment of
the leaf sculpture which, though composed
carefully enough and far enough in itself
from being a piece of crude realism, is
yet realistic in its disposition&mdash;suggesting
the natural fall of sprays and branches of
leafage allowed to dry and harden in the
sun. No architect&mdash;as we now understand
the term&mdash;no architect, even one who
had kept himself free from the neo-classic
influence and the teaching of the schools,
could have designed such a piece as this.
It is the more interesting to see how the
highly trained decorative artist who has
not been fettered by the taught maxims
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of the architect's school or the architect's
office has handled this problem&mdash;a problem
rarely met by decorators of modern
experience.</p>

</div>

<p>About 1876 these same demands upon
him for decoration led him to the careful
observation of ancient stained
glass, with a view to providing the
modern world with something
which might be to it what the windows
of Reims Cathedral and Fairford
Church were to the Middle
Ages. It appeared to the modern
artist that there was still a course
open to him which had not been
tried by the decorators of the Middle
Ages, early or late. It appeared
that the modern materials
and processes of glassmaking
might give to the artist in glass a
"palette" such as the mediæval
man had never possessed. What
is called opal glass, opaline, and
also opalescent glass may be said
to have formed the basis of a new
system of window decoration,
though the other essential, the leaden
framework, was to play its own
part in the artistical result. Uncolored
opaline glass has a milky-white
look when seen by reflected
light; but by transmitted light its
color passes from a cloudy bluish-gray
to red, with a yellow spark.
If, now, such glass be charged
with color of many shades, the
chromatic effects producible by the
combination of such translucent
materials, at once contrasting in
color and harmonized by the opaline
quality, might prove successful
beyond what had been known.
To this, then, La Farge set himself;
to obtain glass of richness, depth, and
glow of color hitherto unattempted, and
in a multitude of tints; so that, whereas
the thirteenth-century artist had five or six
colors in all, susceptible of nothing more
than a gradation from darker to lighter, as
the glass was thicker or thinner or more
or less thickly flashed&mdash;now, colors were
to be supplied by the score, each color
capable of these same gradations in darker
and lighter, and each color harmonized
with all the other colors by the common
quality of softness and a certain misty
iridescence caused by the opaline stain.
Even in a piece of glass so brilliant in color
that the opalescence is hardly perceptible,
its presence in that part of the general
chromatic scheme will surely be felt.</p>

</div>

<p>A window is, when considered as a
work of fine art in color, a translucent
composition, there being no part of it
which can appeal to the eye by other than
transmitted light. The artist has, then, the
need of something strong to lean upon,
some background, some <i>fond</i> upon which
to relieve his more brilliant pieces of translucency;
for it can be easily understood
that color composition which is wholly
translucent will tend toward feebleness,
toward paleness, toward a certain evanescent
and doubtful character of its colors,
from which it must be saved. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
needed background
was found in the
use of the leads;
that is to say, of
those strips of lead
made generally in
the form of a capital
I, in which the
edges of the separate
pieces of glass
are held. By taking
these leads as
the artistic sub-structure
of the
composition, by
placing them where
needed, and by cutting
the glass accordingly,
by combining
the colors of
the glass in such a
way as to allow the
leads to be put
where they were
needed for this purpose
of background,
results were obtained
which no artist
in glass had ever
yet attempted. La
Farge's use of leads,
in this way, remains
peculiarly his own
in the subtlety and
refinement of the
linear design.
Occasionally,
indeed, a certain amount
of opaque
painting, of
that solid non-translucent
painting which the men of the Middle
Ages used continually, has been used to
increase the area of his lead sash-bars
or to diminish the brilliancy of a background.
All artists recognize the need
of the <i>repentir</i>, of the amendment made
after the work is partly done, or even, to
all eyes but their own, completed; and
painting in opaque color has been used
by La Farge when it has appeared that
the lead-sash was not quite sufficient for
the background needed. In like manner,
painting in translucent colored enamels
has been used by him where it has appeared
to him that no glass available
would produce the tone desired. As such
instances are occasional and rare, these
devices are not a part of the essence of La
Farge's work in glass, and they are mentioned
here merely because their existence
must be understood as accidental. The
treatment of heads and hands and other
necessarily nude parts of the body, in
order that these surfaces may harmonize
with the generally unpainted drapery and
background, would require pages of discussion
if entered upon at all.</p>

<p>The purpose of this article is not, however,
to dwell in detail upon the historical
development of his art, but to criticise it
in its main features, and to institute an inquiry
into those traits of La Farge's personality
which have made his work especially
interesting to all persons who care
for the retention of noble design in that
which is obviously novel, original, modern
in art.</p>

</div>

<p>In the first place, then, Mr. La Farge
is very individual as a designer. He hardly
belongs to any school of designers. The
reader will suggest at once that, as there
is no school of designers at the present
day, a man of
force is compelled
to be individual;
and this dictum
will be readily accepted.
Inasmuch
as there has been
no time since La
Farge reached the
age of intelligence
and of interest in
art&mdash;no time when
he has not been a
student of Japanese
art; inasmuch
as he began, as
long ago as 1860,
to buy and study
what few pieces of
Japanese art and
handicraft he
could find&mdash;it has
been thought that
he is strongly influenced
by Japanese
design; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
this it will be hard to establish. His design
is individual and personal, and it is that
whether we take design to mean his way of
conceiving the human figure; or his way of
composing human figures in large groups
with care for the
effect of line and
mass; or whether
we think, rather,
of the filling of
the panel or the
canvas, the parallelogram or the
half-circle, with
masses of color
and tendencies of
line.</p>

</div>

<p>Now, in this individuality
of his
art, there is a
weaker as well as
a stronger side.
It cannot be ignored
by those
who admire his
larger and statelier
designs that
they lack something
of stateliness.
The figures
in his small woodcuts are carried
out of the strict
and grave system
of academic
drawing into an
extreme of freedom of gesture
and movement,
and that with the
evident purpose
of expressing in
the strongest possible
way the intense meaning of
the artist; but this hardly allows of mention
except as a virtue. Bishop Hatto in his
screaming agony, as the rats attack him
on every side while he crouches at the foot
of the column on the capital of which the
cat has taken refuge (for each and all the
details of which see Southey's poem)&mdash;Bishop
Hatto is almost liquified, has almost
lost the solid substance of his corporeal
form, in his horror and hopelessness.
Enoch Arden, "the long-haired, long-bearded
solitary," hardly shows the strong
man, the vigorous sailor under his rags and
through his squalor; the emphasis is laid
on the fourteen years' solitary confinement
in this lonely island, and the "strong
heroic soul" which the poet drew has not
interested the artist as part of this design.
These are small drawings for wood-engraving
and for book illustration; but the
same character of design occurs again and
again in the larger and statelier pieces;
and it may there be less easy to accept.
The impression made upon a student of
mural painting, ancient and modern, by
such a painting as that in the Church of
the Ascension is that it is, in a sense, lacking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
in repose. The
Adoring Angels
around the risen Saviour
are individual in
their gestures, in the
pose of their bodies,
in the expression of
their faces. They
are personalities rather
than parts of a
"Glory of Angels."
The figure of Christ
itself has the same
peculiarity and is
marked by a singularly
free and unconventional
pose of the
body and gesture of
the right arm, suggestive rather of the
teacher of men than of the Son taken
up to his Father. Moreover, this effect
as of too much movement and incident,
as of too little stability and gravity, is
heightened by the flowing drapery, which
is so marked a feature of the composition
that it remains uppermost in the
minds of many students to the very end
of their study of the picture. Something
of this may be seen in the illustration given
here of the noble window which was sent
to the Exhibition of 1889 [<a href="#i-022">page 15</a>]. The
subject is the Sealing of the Servants of
God. These groups are of indubitable
truth and power as illustrations of the passage
in the Apocalypse; but as parts of
a solemn color design another standard
needs to be applied to them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-020" id="i-020"></a>
<img src="images/i-020.jpg" width="448" height="328" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Floating Head.</p>
</div>

<p>So much for the less agreeable side of
this familiar and personal way of designing.
In the favorable aspect there would,
of course, be very much to be said, for he
is no illustrator, he is no story-teller, he is
no composer of pictured fable or pictured
record who does not understand how to
give his figures that life and movement,
that action and expression, which will explain
all that is explainable of their purpose
and their function. Nothing, for instance,
can be more perfect as a bit of mystical
story-telling than the Wolf-Charmer, the
picture in which the gaunt and haggard
magician, with his pipe at his lips,
comes out of the forest surrounded by his
drove of gigantic wolves. Two studies
for the wolves are given here; and the
spirit of the design is interesting to trace in
them. To give the savage creatures something
more than their due size, and, above
all, something more than their due ferocity,
is a natural and obvious device; but to
express, as the artist has expressed, their
familiarity with their leader, their sympathy
with him, their spirit entering into his as
he heads and controls them, is something
admirable in descriptive art. So in that
grim picture in which some part of the
spirit of feudal Japan is contained; the
picture which tells the tale of little Kio-Sai;
the rushing and turbulent stream between
its high banks is gray and sombre
as if with the swollen waters of a flood;
and upon it, whirled along in its course, the
severed head which frightened the child
floats face upward with something of its
living expression still lingering about the
eyes and lips, but still as dead, as corpse-like
as a severed head could be. This
powerful drawing, made within the last
two years, is to be cited as a characteristic
specimen of expressional art. There is
nothing in the picture but whirling water
and floating head; and yet the stern,
fierce, half-savage, feudal system of Japan,
which coexisted with an almost too subtle
refinement of manners and of thought,
both literary and artistic, is expressed in
this little square of grave coloring. So,
in the numerous South Sea Island studies
which have filled many a frame and delighted
so many a student of water-color
drawings, it is hard to say whether the
pictures of movement and action, of fishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
with cormorants, of riding and marching,
of bustle and life, or the pictures of
tropical and oriental men and women in
repose, are more delightful&mdash;half naked
girls carrying canoes, seated dancers going
through the sacred movements of the <i>siva</i>,
portraits of individuals, and studies of
groups intended to preserve for the artist
the recollection, and for the instruction of
those at home the singular life, of these
brown islanders, so different from the
negroids of the southern groups, so over-civilized
in ceremony and tradition, with
all their lack of policing and of steady social
conditions. In all this work the
artist's indifference to the accepted conventional
ways of expressing his meaning
is altogether fortunate for his art. He
knows how to tell a story in pictures which
have very much, if not all, of his highest
artistic qualities, and this he would hardly
be capable of were he more fettered than
he is by the rules of the academies as to
how the action of man should be put into
form and color.</p>

</div>

<p>In connection with this matter, the question
comes up how far Mr. La Farge is a
thorough draughtsman. It hardly becomes
one who is not ready to go into the minute
examination of his work, figure by
figure, to challenge its merit in the way of
anatomical correctness and academic severity
of drawing; but it is to be said, at
least, that the strongest reason exists for
the belief that many of the draped figures
would prove incorrect if an absolutely accurate
drawing of the nude body in the
position assumed by the draped figure
could be laid upon the drapery. It is
difficult here to express one's exact meaning,
because there is no such thing as an
absolutely correct drawing of the nude
body in any position; but if we take a
draped angel or a draped St. Peter or a
draped Buddhist priest from this gallery
of pictured men and women, we can imagine
the consummate draughtsman, the
Paul Veronese of the present, if there were
such a man, pointing out that a figure seated
or standing in that position could not
get within the drapery which the artist
has pictured. We can even imagine the
painter aware of the fact&mdash;in advance of
all criticism by others. It will be observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
that La Farge has seldom painted the
nude. His early work involved a great
deal of drawing, both from the nude model
and in the way of designed and composed
nude figures. Naked figures represented
on a small scale, as among his
numerous Eastern subjects, exist, of course,
in his work in great numbers; but the
nude in the larger European sense of elaborately
rendered, well modelled, thoroughly
understood naked figures, male and female,
is rare in his work. Mural painting
in churches hardly allows of that; glass
is, of course, wholly foreign in its purpose
and mission from such art as includes the
nude, and hardly allows even of the naked
hands and head. Now, let it be admitted
for the moment not only that La Farge is
not given to drawing the nude, but even
that he has not done consummate work in
that direction; let that be admitted, and
let us then see how that affects his pictures
and drawings. It need not be asked
whether it affects the decorative value of
his work&mdash;considered as a body of art it
cannot affect it badly; we need think,
now, only of fine drawing
considered by itself. It is
a part of the true traditional
doctrine of art that
no man should paint from
the model, nude or draped;
that no man should draw
from the model, nude or
draped, with the intention
of using the drawing upon
his wall surface or canvas.
It is a tradition which
ought to have been left intact
as it came from older
men, that when the artist
composes it is his duty to
forget his anatomy and to
forget the preparatory
drawings which he has
made by hundreds, and to
draw directly upon his canvas
or sheet of paper the
figure which he now conceives
as a part of his design,
the figure which he
desires to put into his composition
as one of its elements.
He is free then to
do what La Farge himself
does freely, to compare this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
result with the model,
nude or draped, or first
nude and then draped;
but this comparison has
for its purpose, not the
correction of the drawing
or the picture with
reference to its anatomical
correctness nearly so
much as it has in view
the lifelike appearance of
the figure. Given a
draped figure which does
not seem to stand quite
as firmly upon its feet, or
to be moving quite as
freely, as the composer
himself desires, it is required
by consultation of
the model to rectify those
errors in the drawing
which have led to this
unfortunate result and to
give to that figure the
lifelike character which
it does not yet possess.</p>

</div>

<p>It is a characteristic of
Mr. La Farge's art as a
painter that he is primarily
a colorist. Now it is
fairly safe to say that no
man since the great Venetians
has been at once
a consummate draughtsman
of the human figure
and a consummate master
of color; and that apparently
the mind of the
workman cannot lead his
artistic production in
such paths that both of
these excellences may be
attained at once. The
workman, if he is sincere,
and if he is well advised,
follows the course which
is easiest for him, and if
he conceives of every
figure and every group of
figures with their setting
of landscape or architecture
primarily as a
piece of splendid coloring,
to be taken from
nature as an abstract
piece of coloring, and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
modified that it will tell as an abstract
piece of coloring on canvas or on wall&mdash;if
that is the artist's object he will not improve
the work produced on these lines
by giving his time and strength to the proposed
consideration of accuracy
of drawing.</p>

<p>To ask whether
La Farge's
work would be
artistically better
if it were consummate
in drawing
is to ask a
question which
no one can answer.
It is certain
that no wise
student will go
to La Farge to
learn figure drawing
in the technical
sense. It is
not that which
his art offers the
student. There
are, however, two
large pictures,
which can hardly
be challenged&mdash;the
two lunettes
in the Villard-Reid
house; and
it is probable that
if these pictures
were within easy
reach of the public,
and could be
seen as the wall
paintings in the Congressional Library
can be seen by all the world and every
day, they would tend to raise the general
opinion of La Farge's capacity and
range as a painter beyond what even
his admirers now hold. The pictures
represent "The Dance" and "Music." In
each of them, smiling landscape forms the
background, a landscape not to be called
sunny because the work of the true colorist
hardly allows of sunshine. Sunshine
and full glowing color are not generally
found possible of simultaneous presentation,
and La Farge certainly makes no attempt
to combine them. If, then, we consider
one of these two groups of six or
eight maidens invested in rather bright
and high-lighted colors and set off by a
landscape somewhat deeper in tone than
their own figures&mdash;if we consider each of
these pictures as a mural painting intended
to be festal in
character and to
glorify and
heighten the
beauty of the
room which it
adorns, while at
the same time it
is in itself a piece
of coloring of almost
the highest
quality&mdash;we
have then, perhaps,
the fairest
and most complete
idea of what
one of these lunettes
is as a
work of art&mdash;what
it has been
in the artist's well-realized purpose.
The beauty of
composition in
line and mass in
either of the pictures,
noticeable
as it is, is not important
in comparison. The
power of line-composition is
not very rare; except
in its very
highest manifestation,
it is almost like correct spelling;
necessary, but deserving no special remark.
But when it is said of any picture
that it is a piece of coloring of the highest
or almost the highest rank, there has
been said of it the utmost that can be
said of a work of graphic art. It is not
claimed that color is essentially greater
or nobler than form, but that color is the
graphic artist's especial domain, in which
he alone can rule; and further, that color
is peculiarly artistical, ideal, abstract, and
in this way loftier. Is it possible for the
mind of man to conceive of anything
more perfect, more remote from, and, in
a sense, superior to, whatever else there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
is in the world of humanity than a color composition of the highest quality? There
is only one product of the human mind which can be compared with it;
a musical composition of the highest class; a symphony of
Beethoven, alone, can be compared to a great composition
by Titian. That such a color-gift and such a color-purpose
are to be seen in all of Mr. La Farge's
work alike would be hardly too much to say.
The touch of the consummate colorist is not
as evident, but is as discoverable by one
who knows how to look, in a piece of
nature-study from Fiji, six inches
square, as it is in a large composition
of saints and angels. The
disposition and the power to give
to tinted paper the glow, the
radiance, the wealth and charm
of that strange and inexplicable
thing, the mingling of
tints into a resulting color-scheme&mdash;these
are in small
work the same essentially
that they are in large.
Nor is the background
of the Ascension picture
in the eponymic
church to be exalted
above the bits of hillside
and surf in the
drawings of oceanic
life, otherwise than as
its greater size allows
it greater splendor.</p>

<p>That this power over
color is the life and soul
of the decorator need
hardly be urged. Decoration
which is applied to a
flat surface and which is
not in relief, except, perhaps,
to a slight extent and occasionally,
has for its main object,
its main <i>desideratum</i>, richness
or refinement of coloring,
or both. If one has a wall to
decorate, the first idea of the true
decorator is to invest it with splendor
or with delicate strength of color. He
seeks for fresco, or the encaustic process, or
mosaic, or, as in modern times, oil-painting
upon a strained canvas, indifferently and according
to the spirit of his time and the practice
of his contemporaries; but his object is one and the
same&mdash;to invest his wall or ceiling with noble color. Little
may he care what the subject of the painting or mosaic may be.
According to the requirements of the epoch or community in which he lives,
it may be a procession of saints or a dance of bacchanals; the primary object which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
he has in view is to procure a most enjoyable
and delightful piece of color&mdash;and
other things are of secondary importance.
Glass, then, would seem to be especially
prepared for La Farge's work, and La
Farge especially prepared for glass. Consider
the memorial window which fills a
window-opening in a church at North
Easton, Mass., a town which owes much
to the lady whose memory is thus honored.
Upon a background of broken
and changing blue are relieved the three
figures larger than life-size which nearly
fill the opening. Two of these figures are
clothed, one in drapery of the most vivid
green, the other in drapery of orange-brown;
that is to say, these are the general
colors offered to the eye of the spectator
by the infinite number of minor tints, all
passing into one another in subtle gradation,
which make up the general mass of
drapery. It is to be observed, then, that
these figures are also seen to be clothed
in rags, and that the idea, the notion of
wretchedness and tatters is maintained in
spite of the sumptuous clothing of glowing
color which invests it all. That is an instance
as good as can be found of what
the colorist has to do in this world. He
does not ask whether beggars have ever
been dressed in such garments as have
been described, but he has to express the
two-fold image, Beggary and splendid
color, and out of these he makes up his
work of art, as unlike as may be to anything
in nature, but none the worse for
that. To return to mural painting; there
is one merit which all La Farge's brother-painters
agree in awarding to him, and
that is the power of putting a painting
upon the wall so that it does not change
the character of the wall as a part of
the building. His painting takes nothing
away from the solidity of the wall which
it invests. The upright mass retains its
rigidity and weight, it still carries the roof,
it still holds firmly to the adjoining walls,
it is a massive and trustworthy part of the
construction, and the painted picture has
added to rather than taken from its permanent
and resting quality. How this is
done is fully as inexplicable as is the glow
and splendor of color itself. No one can
say abstractly and without having the picture
immediately before him how any such
result is attained, nor is it easy to explain
the picture, even to the looker-on, in any
such terms as will fully express this quality.
It is one of the most valuable qualities
which mural painting can possess&mdash;mural
painting which fluctuates between the flatness
which is also feebleness and a kind
of realism which carries with it the effect
of out-of-doors&mdash;of a hole in the wall.
The same thing obtains in his minor work,
and here the background, the temple, or
rock, forty feet away, is as perfectly detached
from the foreground figures as
would be a distant and airy mountain
miles away, while still the picture remains
flat cardboard or flat canvass invested
with light and shade and color.</p>

</div>

<p>We are brought naturally to the consideration
of Mr. La Farge's landscape.
He is not generally considered as a landscape
painter; and yet he has produced
a great deal of landscape in the secondary
or accessory part of his work. He has
also painted landscape of first intention,
so to speak, landscape which is nothing
but landscape, and that, at different times
in his life; always succeeding, and yet
always turning away from landscape to
what seems to be his chosen work of figure
subject used decoratively. Landscape-painting
is unquestionably the art of our
epoch, the one branch of the art of painting
which this century has excelled in;
and, therefore, La Farge was inevitably
drawn toward landscape painting, he being
a man of his time, if also a man of
strong individual peculiarities. It would
be hard for a student of art in the abstract,
a theorizer, a critic and a lover of
the arts of the past, to avoid painting
landscape when everybody around him is painting
landscape; and accordingly La Farge
has turned his attention to that, but the
odd thing is that he has not stayed there,
that he has not continued to be a landscape
painter primarily. It would seem to
the hasty observer of landscape painting
that this department of art alone would
have afforded material for all of his artistic
dreams and for all his artistic purposes,
for what is more truly decorative than
landscape such as is shown in the wonderful
Paradise Valley? That picture is made
up of light and color. The surface of
thick, lush, summer grass, the surface of
rock dimly seen, the surface of ocean, the
hazy sky, all together go to form a mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
of glowing and yet delicate color the like
of which it is very hard to find in simple
landscape anywhere in ancient or modern
art. Until recent years there were only
half a dozen such pictures of wide landscape,
numerous as were his studies in that
style; for otherwise his finished landscapes
were chiefly those composed of
foreground rock, of iris seen against a wild-rose
covered bank, of three or four water-lily
blossoms and a dozen little buds floating
on still water; or else they were landscape
backgrounds to figure subjects in
which the landscape was evidently made,
of deliberate purpose, a thing of less intention
and of inferior interest. During
the last ten years, however, La Farge has
produced an immense number of singularly
effective drawings in monochrome and in
color, made either on the spot in Samoa,
in Fiji, in Japan, or elsewhere in the far
East, or made after his return home, from
studies carefully noted during his stay
abroad. Of these landscape drawings,
some are of extended and really vast
stretches of country. Mountains are introduced
which are several miles away,
and show in relief against a pale sky, every
detail of the mountain being rendered as
the eye could have seen it from the point
of view occupied by the painter, and the
whole wrought into a wonderfully glowing
panorama of green passing into blue against
the green mystery of the firmament.
There are also among these drawings
pictures which are Turnerian in their love
of and sympathy with mist and vapor and
their enjoyment of pure and delightful
color produced by sunlight upon such
vapor. Among these are four drawings
of the Valley of Tokio seen from a hill
above the city, the vision of the artist
reaching across the valley and including
its whole extent and the mountains which
form the boundary. In other words, each
of these landscapes includes a range of
one hundred square miles of country at
least, and its investing and overflowing
drapery of cloud and of low-lying vapor;
and yet these were four small drawings,
mere studies on leaves of a sketch-book.
It is the greatest misfortune to Americans
that they have been scattered among four
different owners. If it were possible for
the Boston Museum, under its wise direction,
to gather these four drawings into its
ownership and to exhibit them side by side
well lighted and isolated from other conflicting
art, a real service would be done
to the whole community of art students;
for there is in them an abundance of the
true landscape feeling, of the true landscape
sympathy, of that love of the magnificence,
and the refinement of nature
which no transcript can give, but which
the thought of the artist when stimulated
powerfully by the contemplation of the
glory of nature will transfer to his material
medium.</p>

<p>Much of this character exists in the
sepia drawing of the "Dry Bed of the
Dayagawa River," [<a href="#i-014">page 7</a>] which hardly
needs analysis in words, since it is capable
of fairly complete reproduction.</p>

<h2>THE
LETTERS OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON<br />
Edited by Sidney Colvin</h2>

<p class="center">FROM BOURNEMOUTH: 1884-1885</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-027a.jpg" width="71" height="73" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">In order of date the letters now to be quoted follow next on those from
the French Riviera which were printed in the April number. When
in the late spring of 1884 Stevenson was prostrated by the worst of
all his many attacks of hemorrhage from the lung, he was still residing
in that chalet at Hyères which he had hoped to make his permanent
abode. Partly the renewed failure of his health, and partly a bad
outbreak of cholera in the old Provençal town, which occurred in the ensuing summer,
compelled him to abandon this hope. As soon as he recovered strength enough
to be able to travel by even the easiest stages, he moved to Royat in Auvergne, and
thence in the course of July to England. After consultation with several doctors,
all of whom held out good hopes of ultimate recovery in spite of the gravity of his
present symptoms, he moved to Bournemouth. Here he found in the heaths and
pine-woods some distant semblance of the landscape of his native Scotland, and in
sandy curves of the Channel coast a passable substitute for the bays and
promontories of his beloved Mediterranean. At all events he liked the place well enough to
be willing to try it for a home: and such it became for all but three years, from September,
1884, to August, 1887. These, although in the matter of health the worst and
most trying years of his life, were in the matter of work some of the most active and
successful. For the first two or three months the Stevensons occupied a lodging on
the West Cliff called Wensleydale; for the next three or four, from December, 1884,
to March, 1885, they were tenants of a house named Bonallie Towers, pleasantly situated amid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the pine-woods of Branksome Park; and lastly, about Easter, 1885, they
entered into occupation of a house of their own, given by the elder Stevenson to his
son, and re-named by the latter Skerryvore, in reminiscence of one of the great lighthouse
works carried out by the family firm off the Scottish coast. During all the
time of Stevenson's residence at Bournemouth he was compelled to lead the life, irksome
to him above all men, but borne with invincible sweetness and patience, of a
chronic invalid and almost constant prisoner to the house. He was hardly ever free
for more than a few weeks at a time from fits of hemorrhage, fever, and prostration,
accompanied by the nervous exhaustion and general distress consequent equally upon
the attacks themselves and upon the remedies which the physicians were constrained
to employ against them. A great part of his time was spent in bed, and there
almost all his literary work was produced. Often for days, and sometimes for weeks
together, he was forbidden to speak aloud, and compelled to carry on conversation
with his family and friends in whispers or with the help of pencil and paper. The
few excursions to a distance which he attempted&mdash;most commonly to my house, at the
British Museum, once to Matlock, once to Exeter, and once in 1886 as far as Paris&mdash;these
excursions almost always ended in a break-down and a hurried retreat to home
and bed. Nevertheless, seizing on and making the most of every week, nay, every day
and hour of respite, he contrived to produce work surprising alike, under the circumstances,
by quantity and quality. During the first two months of his life at Bournemouth
the two plays <i>Admiral Guinea</i> and <i>Beau Austin</i> were written in collaboration
with Mr. Henley. In 1885 he published three volumes, viz.: <i>More New Arabian Nights</i>,
the <i>Child's Garden of Verses</i>, and <i>Prince Otto</i> (the two latter, it is true, having been
for the most part written a year or two earlier, at Hyères). In 1886 appeared <i>The
Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> and <i>Kidnapped</i>, the two books which, together
with <i>Treasure Island</i>, did most to win for him the fame and honor which he
ever afterward enjoyed among readers on both sides of the Atlantic. At the same
time he was a fairly frequent contributor of essays to magazines and of stories to
Christmas annuals and other periodical collections. The year 1887, the last of his
life in the old country, was chiefly, with the exception of the <i>Life of Fleeming Jenkin</i>,
a year of collections and re-prints; in it were published <i>Underwoods, The Merry Men</i>,
<i>Memories and Portraits</i>, and the <i>Black Arrow</i> in volume form.</p>

<p>The correspondence of these three invalid years at Bournemouth is naturally in a
less buoyant key than that of the relatively flourishing and happy year at Hyères
which preceded them. But it is none the less full of interest, and of that vivid play
of mood and character which never failed in him whether he was sick or well. The
specimens which I shall here give will be taken, with a few exceptions, from his communications
with his brother men of letters, including some whose acquaintance or
friendship he had now for the first time formed, as Mr. Henry James, Mr. William
Archer, and Mr. Locker-Lampson, besides such intimate friends and associates of
earlier days as Mr. Henley, Mr. Gosse, Mr. Symonds and myself.</p>

<p>But first come two or three to his parents and other correspondents:</p>

<p class="left45 p2"><span class="smcap">Bournemouth</span>, Sunday, 28th September, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear People</span>,&mdash;I keep better, and
am to-day downstairs for the first time.
I find the lockers entirely empty; not a
cent to the front. Will you pray send us
some? It blows an equinoctial gale, and
has blown for nearly a week. Nimbus
Britannicus; piping wind, lashing rain;
the sea is a fine colour, and wind-bound
ships lie at anchor under the Old Harry
rocks, to make one glad to be ashore.</p>

<p>The Henleys are gone, and two plays
practically done. I hope they may produce
some of the ready.&mdash;I am, ever affectionate
son,</p>

<p class="left65">R. L. S.</p>

<p class="left45 p2">
<span class="smcap">Wensleydale, Bournemouth,</span><br />
October 3rd, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Chatto.</span>&mdash;I have an offer of
£25 for Otto from America. I do not
know if you mean to have the American
rights; from the nature of the contract, I
think not; but if you understood that you
were to sell the sheets, I will either hand
over the bargain to you, or finish it myself
and hand you over the money if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
are pleased with the amount. You see, I
leave this quite in your hands. To parody
an old Scotch story of servant and master:
if you don't know that you have a
good author, I know that I have a good
publisher. Your fair, open, and handsome
dealings are a good point in my
life, and do more for my crazy health
than has yet been done by any doctor.&mdash;Very
truly yours,</p>

<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Robert Louis Stevenson.</span></p>

<p class="p2">[Mr. Stevenson, the elder, had read the
play of <i>Admiral Guinea</i>, written in September
by his son and Mr. Henley in collaboration,
and had objected, with his usual
energy of expression, to the stage confrontation
of profane blackguarding, in
the person of Pew, with evangelical piety
in that of the reformed slaving captain
who gives his name to the piece.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Father</span>,&mdash;Allow me to say,
in a strictly Pickwickian sense, that you
are a silly fellow. I am pained indeed,
but how should I be offended? I think
you exaggerate; I cannot forget that you
had the same impression of the <i>Deacon;</i>
and yet, when you saw it played, were less
revolted than you looked for; and I will
still hope that the <i>Admiral</i> also is not so
bad as you suppose. There is one point,
however, where I differ from you very
frankly. Religion is in the world; I do
not think you are the man to deny the importance
of its rôle; and I have long decided
not to leave it on one side in art.
The opposition of the <i>Admiral</i> and Mr.
Pew is not, to my eyes, either horrible or
irreverent; but it may be, and it probably
is, very ill done: what then? This is a
failure; better luck next time; more power
to the elbow, more discretion, more wisdom
in the design, and the old defeat becomes
the scene of the new victory. Concern
yourself about no failure; they do
not cost lives, as in engineering; they are
the <i>pierres perdues</i> of successes. Fame is
(truly) a vapour; do not think of it; if the
writer means well and tries hard, no failure
will injure him, whether with God or
man.</p>

<p>I wish I could hear a brighter account
of yourself; but I am inclined to acquit
the <i>Admiral</i> after having a share in the
responsibility. My very heavy cold is, I
hope, drawing off; and the change to
this charming house in the forest will, I
hope, complete my re-establishment.&mdash;With
love to all, believe me, your ever
affectionate,</p>

<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Robert Louis Stevenson.</span></p>

<p class="p2">[About the same time, Mr. T. Stevenson
was in some hesitation as to letting
himself be proposed for the office of President
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.]</p>

<p class="left45 p2"><span class="smcap">Bonallie Towers, Bournemouth</span>,<br />
  November, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Father</span>,&mdash;I have no hesitation
in recommending you to let your
name go up; please yourself about an address;
though, I think, if we could meet,
we could arrange something suitable; but
what you propose would be well enough
in a way; but so modest as to suggest a
whine. From that point of view it would
be better to change a little; but this, whether
we meet or not, we must discuss.
Tait, Crystal, the Royal Society, and I, all
think you amply deserve this honour and
far more; it is not the True Blue to call
this serious compliment a "trial"; you
should be glad of this recognition. As
for resigning, that is easy enough if found
necessary; but to refuse would be husky,
unsatisfactory, and a trifle rotten. <i>Sic
subs.</i></p>

<p class="left65">R. L. S.</p>

<p class="p2">My cold is still very heavy; but I carry
it well. Fanny is very much out of
sorts, principally through perpetual misery
with me. I fear I have been a little
in the dumps, which, <i>as you know, sir</i>, is
a very great sin. I must try to be more
cheerful; but my cough is so severe&mdash;my
uvula, larynx, and pharynx being all
to pot&mdash;that I have sometimes most exhausting
nights and very peevish wakenings.
However, this shall be remedied,
and last night I was distinctly better than
the night before. There is, my dear Mr.
Stevenson (so I moralise blandly as we sit
together on the devil's garden-wall), no
more abominable sin than this gloom, this
plaguey peevishness; why (say I) what
matters it if we be a little uncomfortable&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
is no reason for mangling our unhappy
wives. And then I turn and <i>girn</i>
on the unfortunate Cassandra.&mdash;Your fellow
culprit,</p>

<p class="left65">R. L. S.</p>

<p class="p2">With reference to the two following
letters, it should be explained that Stevenson
and his old Edinburgh friend
and comrade, Mr. Baxter (who was also
his man of business), were accustomed in
their correspondence, as the whim took
them, to merge their own identities in
those of two fictitious personages, Johnson-Thomson
and Thomson-Johnson, ex-elders
of the Kirk and types of a certain
cast of Edinburgh character. Their
language is of the broadest Scots; and
for some readers it may be desirable to
mention that "hoast" means cough and
"sculduddery" loose talk.</p>

house, thus proudly styled, as you perceive:
but the deevil a tower ava' can be
perceived (except out of window); this is
not as it should be; one might have hoped,
at least, a turret. We are all vilely unwell.
I put in the dark watches imitating
a donkey with some success, but little
pleasure; and in the afternoon I indulge
in a smart fever, accompanied by aches
and shivers. There is thus little monotony
to be deplored; and what might still
weigh upon me my wife lightens by various
inexplicable attacks, now in the pleasant
morn, now at the noon of night. I,
at least, am a <i>regular</i> invalid; I would
scorn to bray in the afternoon; I would
indignantly refuse the proposal to fever in
the night. What is bred in the bone will
come out, sir, in the flesh; and the same
spirit that prompted me to date my letter
regulates the hour and character of my
attacks.&mdash;I am, sir, yours,</p>

<p class="left45 p2"><span class="smcap">Bonallie Towers, Branksome Park,<br />
Bournemouth</span>, December 8th, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Henry James</span>,&mdash;This is a
very brave hearing from more points than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
one. The first point is that there is a hope
of a sequel. For this I laboured. Seriously,
from the dearth of information and
thoughtful interest in the art of literature,
those who try to practice it with any deliberate
purpose run the risk of finding no
fit audience. People suppose it is "the
stuff" that interests them; they think, for
instance, that the prodigious fine thoughts
and sentiments in Shakespeare impress by
their own weight, not understanding that
the unpolished diamond is but a stone.
They think that striking situations, or good
dialogue, are got by studying life; they
will not rise to understand that they are
prepared by deliberate artifice and set off
by painful suppressions. Now, I want the
whole thing well ventilated, for my own
education and the public's; and I beg
you to look as quick as you can, to follow
me up with every circumstance of defeat
where we differ, and (to prevent the flouting
of the laity) to emphasise the points
where we agree. I trust your paper will
show me the way to a rejoinder; and that
rejoinder I shall hope to make with so
much art as to woo or drive you from
your threatened silence. I would not ask
better than to pass my life in beating out
this quarter of corn with such a seconder
as yourself.</p>

<p>Point the second, I am rejoiced indeed
to hear you speak so kindly of my work:
rejoiced and surprised. I seem to myself
a very rude, left-handed countryman; not
fit to be read, far less complimented, by a
man so accomplished, so adroit, so craftsmanlike
as you. You will happily never
have cause to understand the despair with
which a writer like myself considers
(say) the park scene in Lady Barberina.
Every touch surprises me by its intangible
precision; and the effect when done, as
light as syllabub, as distinct as a picture,
fills me with envy. Each man among
us prefers his own aim, and I prefer mine;
but when we come to speak of performance,
I recognise myself, compared with
you, to be a lout and slouch of the first
water.</p>

<p>Where we differ, both as to the design
of stories and the delineation of character,
I begin to lament. Of course, I am not
so dull as to ask you to desert your walk;
but could you not, in one novel, to oblige
a sincere admirer, and to enrich his shelves
with a beloved volume, could you not,
and might you not, cast your characters
in a mould a little more abstract and academic
(dear Mrs. Pennyman had already,
among your other work, a taste of what I
mean), and pitch the incidents, I do not
say, in any stronger, but in a slightly more
emphatic key&mdash;as it were an episode from
one of the old (so-called) novels of adventure?
I fear you will not; and I suppose
I must sighingly admit you to be
right. And yet, when I see, as it were, a
book of Tom Jones handled with your
exquisite precision and shot through with
those side-lights of reflection in which you
excel, I relinquish the dear vision with regret.
Think upon it.</p>

<p>As you know, I belong to that besotted
class of man, the invalid; this puts me to
a stand in the way of visits. But it is
possible that some day you may feel that
a day near the sea and among pinewoods
would be a pleasant change from town.
If so, please let us know; and my wife
and I will be delighted to put you up and
give you what we can to eat and drink (I
have a fair bottle of claret).&mdash;On the back
of which, believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="p2">P.S.&mdash;I reopen this to say that I have
re-read my paper, and cannot think I
have at all succeeded in being either veracious
or polite. I knew, of course, that I
took your paper merely as a pin to hang
my own remarks upon; but, alas! what
a thing is any paper! What fine remarks
can you not hang on mine! How I have
sinned against proportion and, with every
effort to the contrary, against the merest
rudiments of courtesy to you! You are,
indeed, a very acute reader to have divined
the real attitude of my mind, and
I can only conclude, not without closed
eyes and shrinking shoulders, in the well-worn words</p>

<p class="p2">[During a crippling fit of ill-health,
Stevenson had received a commission for
a sensational story for the Christmas number
of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>. The commission
ended in his sending the managers
of the paper a recast of a gruesome tale
which he had written and condemned in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the Highlands three years before, <i>The
Body-Snatcher</i>. He rightly thought this
beneath his own standard of merit, and
would not take the full fee which had been
offered for it. Two of the following letters
to Mr. Henley refer to this matter:

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lad</span>,&mdash;I have made up my mind
about the P. M. G., and send you a copy,
which please keep or return. As for not
giving a reduction, what are we? Are
we artists or city men? Why do we sneer
at stockbrokers? O nary; I will not
take the £40. I took that as a fair price
for my best work; I was not able to produce
my best; and I will be damned if I
steal with my eyes open. <i>Sufficit.</i> This
is my lookout. As for the paper being
rich, certainly it is; but I am honourable.
It is no more above me in money than
the poor slaveys and cads from whom I
look for honesty are below me. Am I
Pepys, that because I can find the countenance
of "some of our ablest merchants,"
that because &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; pour forth languid
twaddle and get paid for it, I, too,
should "cheerfully continue to steal"?
I am not Pepys. I do not live much to
God and honour; but I will not wilfully
turn my back on both. I am, like all the
rest of us, falling ever lower from the
bright ideas I began with, falling into
greed, into idleness, into middle-aged and
slippered fireside cowardice; but is it you,
my bold blade, that I hear crying this
sordid and rank twaddle in my ear?
Preaching the dankest Grundyism and
upholding the rank customs of our trade&mdash;you,
who are so cruel hard upon the
customs of the publishers? O man, look
at the Beam in our own Eyes; and whatever
else you do, do not plead Satan's
cause, or plead it for all;
either embrace the bad, or
respect the good when you
see a poor devil trying for
it. If this is the honesty
of authors&mdash;to take what
you can get and console
yourself because publishers
are rich&mdash;take my name
from the rolls of that association.

of weaker thieves, jealous
of the stronger.&mdash;Ever

Bloody Jack; not writing, not hearing,
and finding myself gently and agreeably
ill used; and behold I learn you are bad
yourself. Get your wife to send us a word
how you are. I am better decidedly.
Bogue got his Christmas card, and behaved
well for three days after. It may
interest the cynical to learn that I started
this hæmorrhage by too sedulous attentions
to my dear Bogue. The stick was
broken; and that night Bogue, who was
attracted by the extraordinary aching of
his bones, and is always inclined to a
serious view of his own ailments, announced
with his customary pomp that
he was dying. In this case, however, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
was not the dog that died. (He had tried
to bite his mother's ankles.) I have written,
with the aid of bloudie Jack, a long
and peculiarly solemn paper on the technical
elements of style. It is path-breaking
and epoch-making; but I do not
think the public will be readily convoked
to its perusal. Did I tell you that S. C.
had risen to the paper on James? At
last! O but I was pleased; he's (like
Johnnie) been lang, lang o' comin', but
here he is. He will not object to my
future man&oelig;uvres in the same field, as he
has to my former. All the family are

one country as good as another; and in

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Boy</span>,&mdash;I trust this finds you well;
it leaves me so-so. The weather is so
cold that I must stick to bed, which is
rotten and tedious, but can't be helped.</p>

<p>I find in the blotting book the enclosed,
which I wrote to you the eve of my blood.
Is it not strange? That night, when I
naturally thought I was coopered, the
thought of it was much in my mind; I
thought it had gone; and I thought what
a strange prophecy I had made in jest,
and how it was indeed like to be the end
of many letters. But I have written a
good few since, and the spell is broken.
I am just as pleased, for I earnestly desire
to live. This pleasant middle age
into whose port we are steering is quite
to my fancy. I would cast anchor here,
and go ashore for twenty years, and see
the manners of the place. Youth was a
great time, but somewhat fussy. Now in
middle age (bar lucre) all seems mighty
placid. It likes me; I spy a little bright
café in one corner of the port, in front of
which I now propose we should sit down.
There is just enough of the bustle of the
harbour and no more; and the ships are
close in, regarding us with stern-windows&mdash;the
ships that bring deals from Norway
and parrots from the Indies. Let us sit
down here for twenty years, with a packet
of tobacco and a drink, and talk of art
and women. By the by, the whole city
will sink, and the ships too, and the table,
and we also; but we shall have sat for
twenty years and had a fine talk; and by
that time, who knows? exhausted the
subject.</p>

<p>I send you a book which (or I am mistook)
will please you; it pleased me. But
I do desire a book of adventure&mdash;a romance&mdash;and
no man will get or write me
one. Dumas I have read and re-read
too often; Scott, too, and I am short. I
want to hear swords clash. I want a
book to begin in a good way; a book, I
guess, like <i>Treasure Island</i>, alas! which
I have never read, and cannot though I
live to ninety. I would God that some
one else had written it! By all that I can
learn, it is the very book for my complaint.
I like the way I hear it opens;
and they tell me John Silver is good fun.
And to me it is, and must ever be, a
dream unrealised, a book unwritten: O
my sighings after romance, or even Skeltery,
and O! the weary age which will
produce me neither!</p>

<p class="center p2">CHAPTER I</p>

<p>The night was damp and cloudy, the
ways foul. The single horseman, cloaked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and booted, who pursued his way across
Willesden Common, had not met a traveller,
when the sound of wheels&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the old pilot, "she
must have dropped into the bay a little
afore dawn. A queer craft she looks."</p>

<p>"She shows no colours," returned the
young gentleman musingly.</p>

<p>"They're a-lowerin' of a quarter-boat,
Mr. Mark," resumed the old salt. "We
shall soon know more of her."</p>

<p>"Ay," replied the young gentleman
called Mark, "and here, Mr. Seadrift,
comes your sweet daughter Nancy tripping
down the cliff."</p>

<p>"God bless her kind heart, sir," ejaculated
old Seadrift.</p>

<p class="center p2">CHAPTER I</p>

<p>The notary, Jean Rossignol, had been
summoned to the top of a great house in
the Isle St. Louis to make a will; and
now, his duties finished, wrapped in a
warm roquelaure and with a lantern
swinging from one hand, he issued from
the mansion on his homeward way. Little
did he think what strange adventures
were to befall him!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear S. C.</span>,&mdash;I have addressed a letter
to the G. O. M. <i>à propos</i> of Villainton;
and I became aware, you will be interested
to hear, of an overwhelming respect for
the old gentleman. I can <i>blaguer</i> his failures;
but when you actually address him,
and bring the two statures and records to
confrontation, dismay is the result. By
mere continuance of years, he must impose;
the man who helped to rule England,
before I was conceived, strikes me
with a new sense of greatness and antiquity,
when I must actually beard him with
the cold forms of correspondence. I shied
at the necessity of calling him plain "Sir"!
had he been "My lord," I had been happier;
no, I am no equalitarian. Honour
to whom honour is due; and if to none,
why, then, honour to the old!

I communicate the fact.</p>

<p>Belabour thy brains, as to whom it
would be well to question. I have a small
space; I wish to make a popular book,
nowhere obscure, nowhere, if it can be
helped, unhuman. It seems to me the
most hopeful plan to tell the tale, so far as
may be, by anecdote. He did not die till
so recently, there must be hundreds who
remember him, and thousands who have
still ungarnered stories. Dear man, to the
breach! Up, soldier of the iron dook, up,
Slades, and at 'em! (which, conclusively,
he did not say: the at 'em-ic theory is to
be dismissed). You know piles of fellows

<p class="left45 p2">[<span class="smcap">Bournemouth</span>, Feb. 1885.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colvin</span>,&mdash;You are indeed a
backward correspondent, and much may
be said against you. But in this weather,
and O dear! in this political scene of
degradation, much must be forgiven. I fear
England is dead of Burgessry, and only
walks about galvanised. I do not love to
think of my countrymen these days; nor
to remember myself. Why was I silent?
I feel I have no right to blame any one:
but I won't write to the G. O. M. I do
really not see my way to any form of
signature, unless "your fellow criminal in the
eyes of God," which might disquiet the
proprieties.</p>

<p>About your book, I have always said
go on. [This refers to some kind of a
scheme, I forget what, for the republication
of stray magazine-work of mine under
the title Pictures, Places, and People.]
The drawing of character is a different
thing from publishing the details of a
private career. No one objects to the first,
or should object, if his name be not put
upon it; at the other, I draw the line. In
a preface, if you choose, you might distinguish:
it is besides, a thing for which
you are eminently well equipped, and
which you would do with taste and incision.
I long to see the book. People
like themselves (to explain a little more);
no one likes his life, which is a misgotten
issue, and a tale of failure. To see these
failures either touched upon, or <i>coasted</i>, to
get the idea of a spying eye and blabbing
tongue about the house is to lose all privacy
in life. To see that thing, which we
do love, our character set forth, is ever
gratifying. See how my <i>Talk and Talkers</i>
went; everyone liked his own portrait,
and shrieked about other people's; so it
will be with yours: if you are the least
true to the essential, the sitter will be
pleased: very likely not his friends, and
that from <i>various motives</i>.</p>

<p class="left65">R. L. S.</p>

<p>When will your holiday be? I sent
your letter to my wife, and forget. Keep
us in mind, and I hope we shall be able
to receive you.</p>

<p class="left45 p2"><span class="smcap">Bournemouth</span>, Feb. 1885.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Symonds</span>,&mdash;Yes, we have both
been very neglectful. I had horrid luck:
catching (from kind friends) two thundering
influenzas in August and November;
I recovered from the last with difficulty:
also had great annoyance from hæmorrhagic
leaking; but have come through this
blustering winter with some general success;
in the house, up and down. My
wife, however, has been painfully upset
by my health. Last year, of course, was
cruelly trying to her nerves; Nice and
Hyères are bad experiences; and though
she is not ill, the doctors tell me that prolonged
anxiety may do her a real mischief.
She is now at Hyères collecting our
goods; and she has been ill there, which
has upset my liver and driven me to the
friendly calomel on which I now mainly
live: it is the only thing that stops the
bleeding, which seems directly connected
with the circulation of the liver.</p>

<p>I feel a little old and fagged, and chary
of speech, and not very sure of spirit in
my work; but considering what a year I
have passed, and how I have twice sat
on Charon's pier-head, I am surprising.
The doctors all seem agreed in saying that
my complaint is quite unknown, and will
allow of no prognosis.</p>

<p>My father has presented us with a very
pretty home in this place, into which we
hope to move by May. My <i>Child's Verses</i>
come out next week. <i>Otto</i> begins to appear
in April. <i>More New Arabian Nights</i>
as soon as possible. Moreover, I am
neck deep in Wellington; also a story on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the stocks: <i>The Great North Road</i>. O, I
am busy! Lloyd is at college in Edinburgh.
That is, I think, all that can be
said by the way of news.</p>

<p>Have you read <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>? It
contains many excellent things; above
all, the whole story of a healthy boy's
dealings with his conscience, incredibly
well done.</p>

<p>My own conscience is badly seared: a
want of piety; yet I pray for it, tacitly, every
day; believing it, after courage, the only
gift worth having; and its want, in a man
of any claims to honour, quite unpardonable.
The tone of your letter seemed to
me very sound. In these dark days of
public dishonour, I do not know that one
can do better than carry our private trials
piously. What a picture is this of a nation!
No man that I can see, on any
side or party, seems to have the least sense
of our ineffable shame: the desertion of
the garrisons. I tell my little parable that
Germany took England, and then there
was an Indian Mutiny, and Bismarck said:
"Quite right: let Delhi and Calcutta and
Bombay fall; and let the women and children
be treated Sepoy fashion," and people
say: "O, but that is very different!" And
then I wish I were dead. Millais (I hear)
was painting Gladstone when the news
came of Gordon's death; Millais was much
affected, and Gladstone said: "Why?
<i>It is the man's own temerity!</i>" But why
should I blame Gladstone, when I too am a
Bourgeois? when I have held my peace?
Why did I hold my peace? Because I am
a sceptic: <i>i.e.</i> a Bourgeois. We believe
in nothing, Symonds; you don't, and I
don't; and there are two reasons, out of a
handful of millions, why England stands
before the world dripping with blood and
daubed with dishonour. I will first try to
take the beam out of my own eye; trusting
that even private effort somehow betters
and braces the general atmosphere.
See, for example, if England has shown (I
put it hypothetically) one spark of manly
sensibility, they have been shamed into it
by the spectacle of Gordon. Police-Officer
Cole is the only man that I see to admire.
I dedicate my <i>New Arabs</i> to him
and Cox, in default of other great public
characters.&mdash;Yours ever most affectionately,</p>

<p class="left45 p2"><span class="smcap">Bournemouth</span>, March 16th, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Hamerton</span>,&mdash;Various things
have been reminding me of my misconduct:
First, Swan's application for your
address; second, a sight of the sheets of
your <i>Landscape</i> book; and last, your note
to Swan, which he was so kind as to forward.
I trust you will never suppose me
to be guilty of anything more serious than
an idleness, partially excusable. My ill-health
makes my rate of life heavier than
I can well meet, and yet stops me from
earning more. My conscience, sometimes
perhaps too easily stifled, but still (for my
time of life and the public manners of the
age) fairly well alive, forces me to perpetual
and almost endless transcriptions. On the
back of all this, any correspondence hangs
like a thunder-cloud; and just when I
think I am getting through my troubles,
crack, down goes my health, I have a long
costly sickness, and begin the world again.
It is fortunate for me I have a father, or I
should long ago have died; but the opportunity
of the aid makes the necessity
none the more welcome. My father has
presented me with a beautiful house here&mdash;or
so I believe, for I have not yet seen
it, being a cage bird but for nocturnal
sorties in the garden. I hope we shall
soon move into it, and I tell myself that
some day perhaps we may have the pleasure
of seeing you as our guest. I trust at
least that you will take me as I am, a
thoroughly bad correspondent, and a man,
a hater, indeed, of rudeness in others, but
too often rude in all unconsciousness himself;
and that you will never cease to believe
the sincere sympathy and admiration
that I feel for you and for your work.</p>

<p>About the <i>Landscape</i> [Mr. Hamerton's
book so called], which I had a glimpse of
while a friend of mine was preparing a review,
I was greatly interested, and could
write and wrangle for a year on every
page; one passage particularly delighted
me, the part about Ulysses&mdash;jolly. Then,
you know, that is just what I fear I have
come to think landscape ought to be in
literature; so there we should be at odds.
Or perhaps not so much as I suppose, as
Montaigne says it is a pot with two handles,
and I own I am wedded to the technical
handle, which (I likewise own and
freely) you do well to keep for a mistress.
I should much like to talk with you about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
some other points; it is only in talk that
one gets to understand. Your delightful
Wordsworth trap I have tried on two
hardened Wordsworthians, not that I am
one myself. By covering up the context,
and asking them to guess what the passage
was, both (and both are very clever
people, one a writer, one a painter) pronounced
it a guide-book. "Do you think
it an unusually good guide-book?" I
asked, and both said, "No, not at all!"
Their grimace was a picture when I showed
the original.</p>

<p>I trust your health and that of Mrs.
Hamerton keep better; your last account
was a poor one. I was unable to make
out the visit I had hoped, as (I do not
know if you heard of it) I had a very violent
and dangerous hæmorrhage last
spring. I am almost glad to have seen
death so close with all my wits about me, and
not in the customary lassitude and disenchantment
of disease. Even thus clearly
beheld I find him not so terrible as we
suppose. But, indeed, with the passing of
years, the decay of strength, the loss of all
my old active and pleasant habits, there
grows more and more upon me that belief
in the kindness of this scheme of things,
and the goodness of our veiled God, which
is an excellent and pacifying compensation.
I trust, if your health continues to
trouble you, you may find some of the
same belief. But perhaps my fine discovery
is a piece of art, and belongs to a character
cowardly, intolerant of certain feelings,
and apt to self-deception. I don't
think so, however; and when I feel what
a weak and fallible vessel I was thrust
into this hurly-burly, and with what marvellous
kindness the wind has been tempered
to my frailties, I think I should be
a strange kind of ass to feel anything but
gratitude.</p>

<p>I do not know why I should inflict this
talk upon you; but when I summon the
rebellious pen, he must go his own way;
I am no Michael Scott, to rule the fiend
of correspondence. Most days he will
none of me; and when he comes, it is to
rape me where he will,&mdash;Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="p2">[With Mr. Will H. Low as intermediary,
Stevenson had now been entering into relations
with Messrs. Scribner's Sons for the
publication of his works in America. The
following letter refers to this matter and
to Mr. Low's proposed dedication to R.
L. S. of one of the poems of Keats which
he had been illustrating.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Low</span>,&mdash;Your success has been
immense. I wish your letter had come
two days ago: <i>Otto</i>, alas! has been disposed
of a good while ago; but it was
only day before yesterday that I settled
the new volume of Arabs. However, for
the future, you and the sons of the deified
Scribner are the men for me. Really
they have behaved most handsomely. I
cannot lay my hand on the papers, or I
would tell you exactly how it compares
with my English bargain: but it compares
well. Ah! if we had that copyright,
I do believe it would go far to make
me solvent, ill health and all.</p>

<p>I wrote you a letter to the Rembrandt,
in which I stated my views about the dedication
in a very brief form. It will give
me sincere pleasure; and will make the
second dedication I have received: the
other being from John Addington Symonds.
It is a compliment I value much;
I don't know any that I should prefer.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear you have windows
to do; that is a fine business, I think;
but alas! the glass is so bad nowadays;
realism invading even that, as well as the
huge inferiority of our technical resource
corrupting every tint. Still, anything that
keeps a man to decoration is in this age,
good for the artist's spirit.</p>

<p>By the way, have you seen James and
me on the novel? James, I think in the
August or September&mdash;R. L. S. in the December
<i>Longman</i>. I own I think the <i>école
bête</i>, of which I am the champion, has the
whiphand of the argument; but as James
is to make a rejoinder, I must not boast.
Anyway the controversy is amusing to see.
I was terribly tied down to space, which
has made the end congested and dull. I
shall see if I can afford to send you the
April <i>Contemporary</i>&mdash;but I daresay you
see it anyway&mdash;as it will contain a paper
of mine on style, a sort of continuation of
old arguments on art in which you have
wagged a most effective tongue. It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
sort of start upon my Treatise on the Art

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Gosse</span>,&mdash;I was indeed much
exercised how I could be worked into
Gray; and lo! when I saw it, the passage
seemed to have been written with a single
eye to elucidate the ... worst?... well,
not a very good poem of Gray's.
Your little life is excellent, clean, neat,
efficient. I have read many of your notes,
too, with pleasure. Your connection with
Gray was a happy circumstance; it was a
suitable conjunction.</p>

<p>I did not answer your letter from the
States, for what was I to say? I liked
getting it and reading it; I was rather
flattered that you wrote it to me; and then
I'll tell you what I did&mdash;I put it in the fire.
Why? Well, just because it was very natural
and expansive; and thinks I to myself,
if I die one of these fine nights, this is
just the letter that Gosse would not wish
to go into the hands of third parties. Was
I well inspired? And I did not answer
it because you were in your high places,
sailing with supreme dominion, and seeing
life in a particular glory; and I was peddling
in a corner, confined to the house,
overwhelmed with necessary work, which
I was not always doing well, and, in the
very mild form in which the disease approaches
me, touched with a sort of bustling
cynicism. Why throw cold water?
How ape your agreeable frame of mind?
In short, I held my tongue.</p>

<p>They look ghastly in the cold light of
print; but there is something nice in the
little ragged regimen; for all; the blackguards
seem to me to smile; to have a
kind of childish treble note that sounds in
my ears freshly; not song, if you will, but
a child's voice.</p>

<span class="smcap">Skerryvore, Bournemouth</span><br />
[Midsummer, 1885].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Jenkin</span>,&mdash;You know
how much and for how long I have loved,
respected, and admired him; I am only
able to feel a little with you. But I know
how he would have wished us to feel. I never
knew a better man, nor one to me more
lovable; we shall all feel the loss more
greatly as time goes on. It scarce seems
life to me; what must it be to you? Yet
one of the last things that he said to me
was, that from all these sad bereavements
of yours he had learned only more than
ever to feel the goodness and what we, in
our feebleness, call the support of God;
he had been ripening so much&mdash;to other
eyes than ours, we must suppose he was
ripe, and try to feel it. I feel it is better
not to say much more. It will be to me
a great pride to write a notice of him:
the last I can now do. What more in any
way I can do for you, please to think and
let me know. For his sake and for your
own, I would not be a useless friend: I
know, you know me a most warm one;
please command me or my wife, in any
way. Do not trouble to write to me;
Austin, I have no doubt, will do so, if you
are, as I fear you will be, unfit.</p>

<p>My heart is sore for you. At least you
know what you have been to him; how
he cherished and admired you, how he
was never so pleased as when he spoke of
you; with what a boy's love, up to the
last, he loved you. This surely is a consolation.
Yours is the cruel part: to survive;
you must try and not grudge to him
his better fortune, to go first. It is the
sad part of such relations that one must
remain and suffer; I cannot see my poor
Jenkin without you. Nor you indeed
without him; but you may try to rejoice
that he is spared that extremity. Perhaps
I (as I was so much his confidant) know
even better that you can do, what your loss
would have been to him; he never spoke
of you but what his face changed; it was&mdash;you
were&mdash;his religion.</p>

<p>I write by this post to Austin and to the
Academy.&mdash;Yours most sincerely,</p>

<p class="left45 p2"><span class="smcap">Skerryvore, Bournemouth.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Jenkin</span>,&mdash;I should
have written sooner, but we are in a bustle
and I have been very tired, though still
well. Your very kind note was most welcome
to me. I shall be very much pleased
to have you call me Louis, as he has now
done for so many years. Sixteen, you
say? is it so long? It seems too short
now; but of that we cannot judge and
must not complain.</p>

<p>I wish that either I or my wife could
do anything for you; when we can, you
will, I am sure, command us.</p>

<p>I trust that my notice gave you as little
pain as was possible. I found I had so
much to say, that I preferred to keep it for
another place and make but a note in the
Academy. To try to draw my friend at
greater length, and say what he was to me
and his intimates, what a good influence
in life and what an example, is a desire
that grows upon me. It was strange, as
I wrote the note, how his old tests and
criticisms haunted me; and it reminded
me afresh with every few words how much
I owe to him.</p>

<p>I had a note from Henley, very brief
and very sad. We none of us yet feel the
loss; but we know what he would have
said and wished.</p>

<p>Do you know that Dew-Smith has two
photographs of him, neither very bad;
and one giving a lively, though not flattering
air of him in conversation? If you
have not got them, would you like me to
write to Dew and ask him to give you
proofs?</p>

<p>I was so pleased that he and my wife
had at last made friends; that is a great
pleasure. We found and have preserved
one fragment (the head) of the drawing he
made and tore up when he was last here.
He had promised to come and stay with
us this summer. May we not hope, at
least, some time soon to have one from

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Low</span>,&mdash;I trust you are not
annoyed with me beyond forgiveness: for
indeed my silence has been devilish prolonged.
I can only tell you that I have
been nearly six months (more than six) in
a strange condition of collapse when it
was impossible to do any work and difficult
(more difficult than you would suppose)
to write the merest note. I am now
better, but not yet my own man in the way
of brains, and in health only so-so. I turn
more towards the liver and dyspepsia business,
which is damned unpleasant and
paralysing; I suppose I shall learn (I begin
to think I am learning) to fight this
vast, vague feather-bed of an obsession
that now overlies and smothers me; but in
the beginnings of these conflicts, the inexperienced
wrestler is always worsted; and
I own I have been quite extinct. I wish
you to know, though it can be no excuse,
that you are not the only one of my friends
by many whom I have thus neglected; and
even now, having come so very late into the
possession of myself, with a substantial
capital of debts, and my work still moving
with a desperate slowness&mdash;as a child
might fill a sandbag with its little handfuls&mdash;and
my future deeply pledged, there is
almost a touch of virtue in my borrowing
these hours to write to you. Why I said
'hours' I know not; it would look blue
for both of us if I made good the word.</p>

<p>I was writing your address the other
day, ordering a copy of my next, <i>Prince
Otto</i>, to go your way. I hope you have
not seen it in parts; it was not meant to
be so read; and only my poverty (dishonourably)
consented to the serial evolution.</p>

<p>I will send you with this a copy of the
English edition of the <i>Child's Garden</i>. I
have heard there is some vile rule of the
post-office in the States against inscriptions;
so I send herewith a piece of doggerel
which Mr. Bunner may, if he thinks
fit, copy off the fly leaf.</p>

<p>Sargent was down again and painted a
portrait of me walking about in my own
dining-room, in my own velveteen jacket
and twisting as I go my own moustache;
at one corner a glimpse of my wife, in an
Indian dress and seated in a chair that was
once my grandfather's, but since some
months goes by the name of Henry
James's, for it was there the novelist loved
to sit&mdash;adds a touch of poesy and comicality.
It is, I think, excellent; but is too
eccentric to be exhibited. I am at one extreme
corner; my wife, in this wild dress and
looking like a ghost, is at the extreme other
end; between us an open door exhibits my
palatial entrance hall and a part of my respected
staircase. All this is touched in
lovely, with that witty touch of Sargent's;
but of course it looks dam queer as a
whole.</p>

<p>Pray let me hear from you and give me
good news of yourself and your wife, to
whom please remember me.&mdash;Yours most
sincerely, my dear Low,</p>

<h2>THE CHRONICLES OF AUNT MINERVY ANN<br />
By Joel Chandler Harris</h2>

<p class="center s08"><span class="smcap">Illustrated by A. B. Frost</span></p>

<p class="center p2">AN EVENING WITH THE KU-KLUX</p>

<p>While in Halcyondale attending
the county fair I had a good many
talks with Aunt Minervy Ann, who
was the cook, housekeeper, and general
superintendent of Major Tumlin Perdue's
household. Some of these conversations
have been reported on account of the
whiff and flavor of old times which caused
them to live in my mind, while others perhaps
as important have been forgotten.</p>

<p>In the published reports of these conversations
the name of Hamp, Aunt
Minervy's husband, often occurs. When
a slave, Hamp had belonged to an estate
which was in the hands of the Court of
Ordinary (or, as it was then called, the Inferior
Court), to be administered in the
interest of minor heirs. This was not a
fortunate thing for the negroes, of which
there were above one hundred and fifty.
Men, women, and children were hired
out, some far and some near. They came
back home at Christmas-time, enjoyed a
week's frolic, and were then hired out
again, perhaps to new employers. But
whether to new or old, it is certain that
hired hands in those days did not receive
the consideration that men gave to their
own negroes.</p>

<p>This experience told heavily on Hamp's
mind. It made him reserved, suspicious,
and antagonistic. He had few pleasant
memories to fall back on, and these were
of the days of his early youth, when he
used to trot around holding to his old
master's coat-tails&mdash;the kind old master
who had finally been sent to the insane
asylum. Hamp never got over the idea
(he had heard some of the older negroes
talking about it) that his old master had
been judged to be crazy simply because
he was unusually kind to his negroes, especially
the little ones. Hamp's after-experience
seemed to prove this, for he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
received small share of kindness, as well
as scrimped rations, from those who hired
him.</p>

<p>It was a very good thing for Hamp that
he married Aunt Minervy Ann, otherwise
he would have become a wanderer and a
vagabond when freedom came. Even as
it was, he didn't miss it a hair's breadth.
He "broke loose," as he described it, and
went off, but finally came back and tried
to persuade Aunt Minervy Ann to leave
Major Perdue. How he failed in this has
already been reported. He settled down,
but he acquired no very friendly feelings
toward the white race.</p>

<p>He joined the secret political societies
strangely called "Union Leagues," and
aided in disseminating the belief that the
whites were only awaiting a favorable opportunity
to re-enslave his race. He was
only repeating what the carpet-baggers
had told him. Perhaps he believed the
statement, perhaps not. At any rate, he
repeated it fervently and frequently, and
soon came to be the recognized leader of
the negroes in the county of which Halcyondale
was the capital. That is to say,
the leader of all except one. At church
one Sunday night some of the brethren
congratulated Aunt Minervy Ann on the
fact that Hamp was now the leader of
the colored people in that region.</p>

<p>"What colored people?" snapped Aunt
Minervy Ann.</p>

<p>"We-all," responded a deacon, emphatically.</p>

<p>"Well, he can't lead <i>me</i>, I'll tell you
dat right now!" exclaimed Aunt Minervy Ann.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-042" id="i-042"></a>
<img src="images/i-042.jpg" width="364" height="383" alt="" />
<p class="caption">He wore a blue army overcoat and a stove-pipe hat.&mdash;<a href="#Page_36">Page 36</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Anyhow, when the time came to elect
members of the Legislature (the constitutional
convention had already been held),
Hamp was chosen to be the candidate of
the negro Republicans. A white man wanted
to run, but the negroes said they preferred
their own color, and they had their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
way. They had their way at the polls,
too, for, as nearly all the whites who would
have voted had served in the Confederate
army, they were at that time disfranchised.</p>

<p>So Hamp was elected overwhelmingly,
"worl' widout een'," as he put it, and the
effect it had on him was a perfect illustration
of one aspect of human nature. Before
and during the election (which lasted
three days) Hamp had been going around
puffed up with importance. He wore a
blue army overcoat and a stove-pipe hat,
and went about smoking a big cigar.
When the election was over, and he was
declared the choice of the county, he collapsed.
His dignity all disappeared. His
air of self-importance and confidence deserted
him. His responsibilities seemed
to weigh him down.</p>

<p>He had once "rolled" in the little printing-office
where the machinery consisted
of a No. 2 Washington hand-press, a
wooden imposing-stone, three stands for
the cases, a rickety table for "wetting
down" the paper, a tub in which to wash
the forms, and a sheet-iron "imposing-stone."
This chanced to be my head-quarters,
and the day after the election
I was somewhat surprised to see Hamp
saunter in. So was Major Tumlin Perdue,
who was reading the exchanges.</p>

<p>"He's come to demand a retraction,"
remarked the Major, "and you'll have
to set him right. He's no longer plain
Hamp; he's the Hon. Hamp&mdash;what's
your other name?" turning to the negro.</p>

<p>"Hamp Tumlin my fergiven name,
suh. I thought 'Nervy tol' you dat."</p>

<p>"Why, who named you after me?" inquired
the Major, somewhat angrily.</p>

<p>"Me an' 'Nervy fix it up, suh. She
say it's about de purtiest name in town."</p>

<p>The Major melted a little, but his bristles
rose again, as it were.</p>

<p>"Look here, Hamp!" he exclaimed in
a tone that nobody ever forgot or misinterpreted;
"don't you go and stick
Perdue onto it. I won't stand that!"</p>

<p>"No, suh!" responded Hamp. "I
started ter do it, but 'Nervy Ann say she
ain't gwine ter have de Perdue name
bandied about up dar whar de Legislatur's
at."</p>

<p>Again the Major thawed, and though
he looked long at Hamp it was with
friendly eyes. He seemed to be studying
the negro&mdash;"sizing him up," as the
saying is. For a newly elected member
of the Legislature, Hamp seemed to take
a great deal of interest in the old duties
he once performed about the office. He
went first to the box in which the "roller"
was kept, and felt of its surface carefully.</p>

<p>"You'll hatter have a bran new roller
'fo' de mont's out," he said, "an' I won't
be here to he'p you make it."</p>

<p>Then he went to the roller-frame,
turned the handle, and looked at the
wooden cylinders. "Dey don't look atter
it like I use ter, suh; an' dish yer frame
monst'us shackly."</p>

<p>From there he passed to the forms
where the advertisements remained standing.
He passed his thumb over the type
and looked at it critically. "Dey er
mighty skeer'd dey'll git all de ink off,"
was his comment. Do what he would,
Hamp couldn't hide his embarrassment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Major Perdue scratched off
a few lines in pencil. "I wish you'd get
this in Tuesday's paper," he said. Then
he read: "The Hon. Hampton Tumlin,
recently elected a member of the Legislature,
paid us a pop-call last Saturday.
We are always pleased to meet our distinguished
fellow-townsman and representative.
We trust Hon. Hampton Tumlin
will call again when the Ku-Klux are
in."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," said I, humoring the
joke.</p>

<p>"Sholy you-all ain't gwine put dat in
de paper, is you?" inquired Hamp, in
amazement.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied the Major; "why
not?"</p>

<p>"Kaze, ef you does, I'm a ruint nigger.
Ef 'Nervy Ann hear talk 'bout my name
an' entitlements bein' in de paper, she'll
quit me sho. Uh-uh! I'm gwine 'way
fum here!" With that Hamp bowed and
disappeared. The Major chuckled over
his little joke, but soon returned to his
newspaper. For a quarter of an hour
there was absolute quiet in the room, and,
as it seemed, in the entire building, which
was a brick structure of two stories, the
stairway being in the centre. The hallway
was, perhaps, seventy-five feet long,
and on each side, at regular intervals,
there were four rooms, making eight in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
all, and, with one exception, variously
occupied as lawyers' offices or sleeping
apartments, the exception being the printing-office
in which Major Perdue and I
were sitting. This was at the extreme rear
of the hallway.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-044" id="i-044"></a>
<img src="images/i-044.jpg" width="420" height="380" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"Sholy you-all ain't gwine put dat in de paper, is you?"&mdash;<a href="#Page_36">Page 36</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>I had frequently been struck by the
acoustic properties of this hallway. A
conversation carried on in ordinary tones
in the printing-office could hardly be heard
in the adjoining room. Transferred to the
front rooms, however, or even to the sidewalk
facing the entrance to the stairway,
the lightest tone was magnified in volume.
A German professor of music who for a
time occupied the apartment opposite the
printing-office was so harassed by the
thunderous sounds of laughter and conversation
rolling back upon him that he
tried to remedy the matter by nailing two
thicknesses of bagging along the floor
from the stairway to the rear window.
This was, indeed, something of a help, but
when the German left, being of an economical
turn of mind, he took his bagging
away with him, and once more the
hall-way was torn and rent, as you may
say, with the lightest whisper.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that, while the Major
and I were sitting enjoying an extraordinary
season of calm, suddenly there came
a thundering sound from the stairway. A
troop of horse could hardly have made a
greater uproar, and yet I knew that less
than half a dozen people were ascending
the steps. Some one stumbled and caught
himself, and the multiplied and magnified
reverberations were as loud as if the roof
had caved in, carrying the better part of
the structure with it. Some one laughed
at the misstep, and the sound came to our
ears with the deafening effect of an explosion.
The party filed with a dull roar
into one of the front rooms, the office of a
harum-scarum young lawyer who had
more empty bottles behind his door than
he had ever had briefs on his desk.</p>

<p>"Well, the great Gemini!" exclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Major Perdue, "how do you manage to
stand that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders and laughed,
and was about to begin anew a very old
tirade against caves and halls of thunder,
when the Major raised a warning hand.
Some one was saying&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"He hangs out right on ol' Major Perdue's
lot. He's got a wife there."</p>

<p>"By jing!" exclaimed another voice;
"is that so? Well, I don't wanter git
mixed up wi' the Major. He may be
wobbly on his legs, but I don't wanter be
the one to run up ag'in 'im."</p>

<p>The Major pursed up his lips and looked
at the ceiling, his attitude being one of
rapt attention.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" cried another; "by the time
the ol' cock gits his bellyful of dram, thunder
wouldn't roust 'im."</p>

<p>A shrewd, foxy, almost sinister expression
came over the Major's rosy face as
he glanced at me. His left hand went to
his goatee, an invariable signal of deep
feeling, such as anger, grief, or serious
trouble. Another voice broke in here, a
voice that we both knew to be that of
Larry Pulliam, a big Kentuckian who
had refugeed to Halcyondale during the
war.</p>

<p>"Blast it all!" exclaimed Larry Pulliam,
"I hope the Major will come out. Me
an' him hain't never butted heads yit, an'
it's gittin' high time. Ef he comes out,
you fellers jest go ahead with your rat-killin'.
<i>I</i>'ll 'ten' to him."</p>

<p>"Why, you'd make two of him, Pulliam,"
said the young lawyer.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll not hurt 'im; that is, not <i>much</i>&mdash;jest
enough to let 'im know I'm livin' in
the same village," replied Mr. Pulliam.
The voice of the town bull could not have
had a more terrifying sound.</p>

<p>Glancing at the Major, I saw that he
had entirely recovered his equanimity.
More than that, a smile of sweet satisfaction
and contentment settled on his rosy
face, and stayed there.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take a hundred dollars for
that last remark," whispered the Major.
"That chap's been a-raisin' his hackle at
me ever since he's been here, and every
time I try to get him to make a flutter he's
off and gone. Of course it wouldn't do
for me to push a row on him just dry so.
But now&mdash;&mdash;" The Major laughed softly,
rubbed his hands together, and seemed to
be as happy as a child with a new toy.</p>

<p>"My son," said he after awhile, "ain't
there some way of finding out who the
other fellows are? Ain't you got some
word you want Seab Griffin"&mdash;this was
the young lawyer&mdash;"to spell for you?"</p>

<p>Spelling was the Major's weakness. He
was a well-educated man, and could write
vigorous English, but only a few days before
he had asked me how many, <i>f</i>'s there
are in <i>graphic</i>.</p>

<p>"Let's see," he went on, rubbing the
top of his head. "Do you spell <i>Byzantium</i>
with two <i>y</i>'s, or with two <i>i</i>'s, or with one
<i>y</i> and one <i>i</i>? It'll make Seab feel right
good to be asked that before company,
and he certainly needs to feel good if he's
going with that crowd."</p>

<p>So, with a manuscript copy in my hand,
I went hurriedly down the hall and put
the important question. Mr. Griffin was
all politeness, but not quite sure of the
facts in the case. But he searched in his
books of reference, including the Geographical
Gazette, until finally he was able
to give me the information I was supposed
to stand in need of.</p>

<p>While he was searching, Mr. Pulliam
turned to me and inquired what day the
paper came out. When told that the date
was Tuesday, he smiled and nodded his
head mysteriously.</p>

<p>"That's good," he declared; "you'll
be in time to ketch the news."</p>

<p>"What news?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Well, ef you don't hear about it before
to-morrer night, jest inquire of Major
Perdue. He'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p>Mr. Pulliam's tone was so supercilious
that I was afraid the Major would lose
his temper and come raging down the
hallway. But he did nothing of the kind.
When I returned he was fairly beaming.
The Major took down the names in his
note-book&mdash;I have forgotten all except
those of Buck Sanford and Larry Pulliam&mdash;and
seemed to be perfectly happy.
They were all from the country except
Larry Pulliam and the young lawyer.</p>

<p>After my visit to the room, the men
spoke in lower tones, but every word
came back to us as distinctly as before.</p>

<p>"The feed of the bosses won't cost us
a cent," remarked young Sanford. "Tom
Gresham said he'd 'ten' to that. They're
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
in the stable right now. And we're to
have supper in Tom's back room, have a
little game of ante, and along about twelve
or one we'll sa'nter down and yank that
derned nigger from betwixt his blankets,
ef he's got any, and leave him to cool off
at the cross-roads. Won't you go 'long,
Seab, and see it well done?"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-046" id="i-046"></a>
<img src="images/i-046.jpg" width="436" height="396" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Inquired what day the paper came out.&mdash;<a href="#Page_38">Page 38</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"I'll go and see if the supper's well
done, and I'll take a shy at your ante,"
replied Mr. Griffin. "But when it comes
to the balance of the programme&mdash;well,
I'm a lawyer, you know, and you couldn't
expect me to witness the affair. I might
have to take your cases and prove an alibi,
you know, and I couldn't conscientiously
do that if I was on hand at the time."</p>

<p>"The Ku-Klux don't have to have alibis,"
suggested Larry Pulliam.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, still&mdash;" Apparently
Mr. Griffin disposed of the matter with a
gesture.</p>

<p>When all the details of their plan had
been carefully arranged, the amateur Ku-Klux
went filing out, the noise they made
dying away like the echoes of a storm.</p>

<p>Major Perdue leaned his head against
the back of his chair, closed his eyes,
and sat there so quietly that I thought he
was asleep. But this was a mistake. Suddenly
he began to laugh, and he laughed
until the tears ran down his face. It was
laughter that was contagious, and presently
I found myself joining in without
knowing why. This started the Major
afresh, and we both laughed until exhaustion
came to our aid.</p>

<p>"O Lord!" cried the Major, panting,
"I haven't had as much fun since
the war, and a long time before. That
blamed Pulliam is going to walk into a trap
of his own setting. Now you jest watch
how he goes out ag'in."</p>

<p>"But I'll not be there," I suggested.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" exclaimed the Major,
"you can't afford to miss it. It'll be the
finest piece of news your paper ever had.
You'll go to supper with me&mdash;" He
paused. "No, I'll go home, send Valentine
to her Aunt Emmy's, get Blasengame
to come around, and we'll have supper
about nine. That'll fix it. Some of
them chaps might have an eye on my
house, and I don't want 'em to see anybody
but me go in there. Now, if you
don't come at nine, I'll send Blasengame
after you."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-047" id="i-047"></a>
<img src="images/i-047.jpg" width="253" height="358" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"I was on the lookout," the Major explained.</p>
</div>

<p>"I shall be glad to come, Major. I
was simply fishing for an invitation."</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> fish is always on your hook, and
you know it," the Major insisted.</p>

<p>As it was arranged, so it fell out. At
nine, I lifted and dropped the knocker
on the Major's front door. It opened so
promptly that I was somewhat taken by
surprise, but in a moment the hand of my
host was on my arm, and he pulled me inside
unceremoniously.</p>

<p>"I was on the lookout," the Major explained.
"Minervy Ann has fixed to have
waffles, and she's crazy about havin' 'em
just right. If she waits too long to make
'em, the batter'll spoil; and if she puts
'em on before everybody's ready, they
won't be good. That's what she says.
Here he is, you old Hessian!" the
Major cried, as Minervy Ann peeped
in from the dining-room. "Now
slap that supper together and let's
get at it."</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad you come, suh,"
said Aunt Minervy Ann, with a courtesy
and a smile, and then she disappeared.
In an incredibly short
time, supper was announced, and
though Aunt Minervy has since informed
me confidentially that the
Perdues were having a hard time of
it at that period, I'll do her the
credit to say that the supper she
furnished forth was as good as any
to be had in that town&mdash;waffles,
beat biscuit, fried chicken, buttermilk,
and coffee that could not be
surpassed.</p>

<p>"How about the biscuit, Minervy
Ann?" inquired Colonel Blasengame,
who was the Major's brother-in-law,
and therefore one of the
family.</p>

<p>"I turned de dough on de block
twelve times, an' hit it a hunderd an
forty-sev'm licks," replied Aunt
Minervy Ann.</p>

<p>"I'm afeard you hit it one lick too
many," said Colonel Blasengame,
winking at me.</p>

<p>"Well, suh, I been hittin' dat away a
mighty long time," Aunt Minervy Ann
explained, "and I ain't never hear no
complaints."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not complainin', Minervy
Ann." Colonel Blasengame waved his
hand. "I'm mighty glad you did hit the
dough a lick too many. If you hadn't,
the biscuit would 'a' melted in my mouth,
and I believe I'd rather chew on 'em to
get the taste."</p>

<p>"He des runnin' on, suh," said Aunt
Minervy Ann to me. "Marse Bolivar
know mighty well dat he got ter go 'way
fum de Nunited State fer ter git any better
biscuits dan what I kin bake."</p>

<p>Then there was a long pause, which
was broken by an attempt on the part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Major Perdue to give Aunt Minervy Ann
an inkling of the events likely to happen
during the night. She seemed to be both
hard of hearing and dull of understanding
when the subject was broached; or she
may have suspected the Major was joking
or trying to "run a rig" on her.
Her questions and comments, however,
were very characteristic.</p>

<p>"I dunner what dey want wid Hamp,"
she said. "Ef dey know'd how no-count
he is, dey'd let 'im 'lone. What dey want
wid 'im?"</p>

<p>"Well, two or three of the country
boys and maybe some of the town chaps
are going to call on him between midnight
and day. They want to take him out to
the cross-roads. Hadn't you better fix 'em
up a little snack? Hamp won't want anything,
but the boys will feel a little hungry
after the job is over."</p>

<p>"Nobody ain't never
tell me dat de Legislatur'
wuz like de Free Masons,
whar dey have ter ride a
billy goat an' go down in
a dry well wid de chains
a-clankin'. I done tol'
Hamp dat he better not
fool wid white folks' do-in's."</p>

<p>"Only the colored members have to be initiated,"
explained the Major, solemnly.</p>

<p>"What does dey do wid
um?" inquired Aunt Minervy Ann.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the
Major, "they take 'em out
to the nearest cross-roads,
put ropes around their
necks, run the ropes over limbs, and pull
away as if they were drawing water from
a well."</p>

<p>"What dey do dat fer?" asked Aunt
Minervy Ann, apparently still oblivious to
the meaning of it all.</p>

<p>"They want to see which'll break first,
the ropes or the necks," the Major explained.</p>

<p>"Ef dey takes Hamp out," remarked
Aunt Minervy Ann, tentatively&mdash;feeling
her way, as it were&mdash;"what time will he
come back?"</p>

<p>"You've heard about the Resurrection
Morn, haven't you, Minervy Ann?"
There was a pious twang in the Major's
voice as he pronounced the words.</p>

<p>"I hear de preacher say sump'n 'bout
it," replied Aunt Minervy Ann.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Major, "along about
that time Hamp will return. I hope his
record is good enough to give him wings."</p>

<p>"Shuh! Marse Tumlin! you-all des
fool'n' me. I don't keer&mdash;Hamp ain't
gwine wid um. I tell you dat right now."</p>

<p>"Oh, he may not want to go," persisted
the Major, "but he'll go all the
same if they get their hands on him."</p>

<p>"My life er me!" exclaimed Aunt
Minervy Ann, bristling up, "does you-all
'speck I'm gwine ter let um take Hamp
out dat away? De fus' man come ter
my door, less'n it's one er you-all, I'm
gwine ter fling a pan er hot embers in his
face ef de Lord'll gi' me de
strenk. An' ef dat don't
do no good, I'll scald um
wid b'ilin' water. You hear
dat, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Minervy Ann," said
the Major, sweetly, "have
you ever heard of the Ku-Klux?"</p>

<p>"Yasser, I is!" she exclaimed
with startling emphasis.
She stopped still
and gazed hard at the Major.
In response, he merely
shrugged his shoulders
and raised his right hand
with a swift gesture that
told the whole story.</p>

<p>"Name er God! Marse
Tumlin, is you an' Marse
Bolivar and dish yer young
genterman gwine ter set
down here flat-footed and let dem Ku-kluckers
scarify Hamp?"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-048" id="i-048"></a>
<img src="images/i-048.jpg" width="138" height="205" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"Dat's some er 'Nervy Ann's doin's, suh."&mdash;<a href="#Page_43">Page 43</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"Why should <i>we</i> do anything? You've
got everything arranged. You're going to
singe 'em with hot embers, and you're going
to take their hides off with scalding water.
What more do you want?" The Major
spoke with an air of benign resignation.</p>

<p>Aunt Minervy Ann shook her head vigorously.
"Ef deyer de Kukluckers, fire
won't do um no harm. Dey totes der
haids in der han's."</p>

<p>"Their heads in their hands?" cried
Colonel Blasengame, excitedly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>"Dat what dey say, suh," replied Aunt
Minervy Ann.</p>

<p>Colonel Blasengame looked at his watch.
"Tumlin, I'll have to ask you to excuse
me to-night," he said. "I&mdash;well, the fact
is, I have a mighty important engagement
up town. I'm obliged to fill it." He
turned to Aunt Minervy Ann: "Did I
understand you to say the Ku-Klux carry
their heads in their hands?"</p>

<p>"Dat what folks tell me. I hear my
own color sesso," replied Aunt Minervy
Ann.</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to stay with you, Tumlin,"
the Colonel declared; "but&mdash;well, under
the circumstances, I think I'd better fill
that engagement. Justice to my family
demands it."</p>

<p>"Well," responded Major Perdue, "if
you are going, I reckon we'd just as well
go, too."</p>

<p>"Huh!" exclaimed Aunt Minervy Ann,
"ef gwine's de word, dey can't nobody
beat me gittin' way fum here. Dey may
beat me comin' back, I ain't 'sputin' dat;
but dey can't beat me gwine 'way. I'm
ol', but I got mighty nigh ez much go in
me ez a quarter-hoss."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-049" id="i-049"></a>
<img src="images/i-049.jpg" width="414" height="348" alt="" />
<p class="caption">In the third he placed only powder.&mdash;<a href="#Page_44">Page 44</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Colonel Blasengame leaned back in his
chair and studied the ceiling. "It seems
to me, Tumlin, we might compromise on
this. Suppose we get Hamp to come in
here. Minervy Ann can stay out there in
the kitchen and throw a rock against the
back door when the Ku-Klux come."</p>

<p>Aunt Minervy Ann fairly gasped.
"<i>Who? Me?</i> I'll die fust. I'll t'ar
down dat do'; I'll holler twel ev'ybody
in de neighborhood come a-runnin'. Ef
you don't b'lieve me, you des try me.
I'll paw up dat back-yard."</p>

<p>Major Perdue went to the back door
and called Hamp, but there was no answer.
He called him a second time, with
the same result.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Major, "they've
stolen a march on us. They've come
and carried him off while we were talking."</p>

<p>"No, suh, dey ain't, needer. I know
right whar he is, an' I'm gwine atter 'im.
He's right 'cross de street dar, colloguin'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
wid dat ol' Ceely Ensign. Dat's right
whar he is."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-050" id="i-050"></a>
<img src="images/i-050.jpg" width="303" height="349" alt="" />
<p class="caption">We administered to his hurts the best we could.&mdash;Page 45.</p>
</div>

<p>"Old! Why, Celia is young," remarked
the Major. "They say she's the best cook
in town."</p>

<p>Aunt Minervy Ann whipped out of
the room, and was gone some little time.
When she returned, she had Hamp with
her, and I noticed that both were laboring
under excitement which they strove in
vain to suppress.</p>

<p>"Here I is, suh," said Hamp. "'Nervy
Ann say you call me."</p>

<p>"How is Celia to-night?" Colonel
Blasengame inquired, suavely.</p>

<p>This inquiry, so suddenly and unexpectedly
put, seemed to disconcert Hamp.
He shuffled his feet and put his hand to
his face. I noticed a blue welt over his
eye, which was not there when he visited
me in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Well, suh, I speck she's tolerbul."</p>

<p>"<i>Is she? Is she? Ah-h-h!</i>" cried Aunt
Minervy Ann.</p>

<p>"She must be pretty well," said the
Major. "I see she's hit you a clip over
the left eye."</p>

<p>"Dat's some er 'Nervy Ann's doin's,
suh," replied Hamp, somewhat disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Den what you git in de way fer?"
snapped Aunt Minervy Ann.</p>

<p>"Marse Tumlin, dat ar 'oman ain't done
nothin' in de roun' worl'. She say she
want me to buy some hime books fer de
church when I went to Atlanty, an' I went
over dar atter de money."</p>

<p>"<i>I himed 'er an' I churched 'er!</i>" exclaimed
Aunt Minervy Ann.</p>

<p>"Here de money right here," said
Hamp, pulling a small roll of shinplasters
out of his pocket; "an' whiles we settin'
dar countin' de money, 'Nervy Ann come
in dar an' frail dat 'oman out."</p>

<p>"Ain't you hear dat nigger holler,
Marse Tumlin?" inquired Minervy Ann.
She was in high good-humor now. "Look
like ter me dey could a-heerd 'er blate in
de nex' county ef dey'd been a-lis'nin'.
'Twuz same ez a picnic, suh, an' I'm
gwine 'cross dar 'fo' long an' pay my
party call."</p>

<p>Then she began to laugh, and pretty
soon went through the whole episode for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
our edification, dwelling with unction on
that part where the unfortunate victim of
her jealousy had called her "Miss 'Nervy."
The more she laughed the more serious
Hamp became.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-051" id="i-051"></a>
<img src="images/i-051.jpg" width="309" height="397" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"I'd a heap rather you'd pull your shot-gun on me than your pen."&mdash;<a href="#Page_46">Page 46</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>At the proper time he was told of the
visitation that was to be made by the
Ku-Klux, and this information seemed to
perplex and worry him no little. But his
face lit up with genuine thankfulness when
the programme for the occasion was announced
to him. He and Minervy Ann
were to remain in the house and not show
their heads until the Major or the Colonel
or their guest came to the back door and
drummed on it lightly with the fingers.</p>

<p>Then the arms&mdash;three shot-guns&mdash;were
brought out, and I noticed with some
degree of surprise, that as the Major
and the Colonel began to handle these,
their spirits rose perceptibly. The Major
hummed a tune and the Colonel whistled
softly as they oiled the locks and tried the
triggers. The Major, in coming home,
had purchased four pounds of mustard-seed
shot, and with this he proceeded to
load two of the guns. In the third he
placed only powder. This harmless weapon
was intended for me, while the others
were to be handled by Major Perdue and
Colonel Blasengame. I learned afterward
that the arrangement was made solely
for my benefit. The Major and the
Colonel were afraid that a young hand
might become excited and fire too high
at close range, in which event mustard-seed
shot would be as dangerous as the
larger variety.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock I noticed that both
Hamp and Aunt Minervy Ann were growing
restless.</p>

<p>"You hear dat clock, don't you, Marse
Tumlin?" said Minervy as the chimes
died away. "Ef you don't min', de Ku-kluckers'll
be a-stickin' der haids in de
back do'."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>But the Major and the Colonel were
playing a rubber of seven-up (or high-low-Jack)
and paid no attention. It was
a quarter after twelve when the game was
concluded and the players pushed their
chairs back from the table.</p>

<p>"Ef you don't fin' um in de yard waitin'
fer you, I'll be fooled might'ly," remarked
Aunt Minervy Ann.</p>

<p>"Go and see if they're out there," said
the Major.</p>

<p>"<i>Me</i>, Marse Tumlin? <i>Me?</i> I wouldn't
go out dat do' not for ham."</p>

<p>The Major took out his watch. "They'll
eat and drink until twelve or a little after,
and then they'll get ready to start. Then
they'll have another drink all 'round, and
finally they'll take another. It'll be a
quarter to one or after when they get in
the grove in the far end of the lot. But
we'll go out now and see how the land
lays. By the time they get here, our eyes
will be used to the darkness."</p>

<p>The light was carried to a front room,
and we groped our way out at the back
door the best we could. The night was
dark, but the stars were shining. I noticed
that the belt and sword of Orion
had drifted above the tree-tops in the
east, following the Pleiades. In a little
while the darkness seemed to grow less
dense, and I could make out the outlines
of trees twenty feet away.</p>

<p>Behind one of these trees, near the
outhouse in which Hamp and Aunt Minervy
lived, I was to take my stand, while
the Major and the Colonel were to go
farther into the wood-lot so as to greet
the would-be Ku-Klux as they made their
retreat, of which Major Perdue had not
the slightest doubt.</p>

<p>"You stand here," said the Major in a
whisper. "We'll go to the far-end of the
lot where they're likely to come in. They'll
pass us all right enough, but as soon as
you see one of 'em, up with the gun an'
lam aloose, an' before they can get away
give 'em the other barrel. Then you'll
hear from us."</p>

<p>Major Perdue and Colonel Blasengame
disappeared in the darkness, leaving me,
as it were, on the inner picket line. I
found the situation somewhat ticklish, as
the saying is. There was not the slightest
danger, and I knew it, but if you ever
have occasion to stand out in the dark,
waiting for something to happen, you'll
find there's a certain degree of suspense
attached to it. And the loneliness and
silence of the night will take on shape almost
tangible. The stirring of the half-dead
leaves, the chirping of a belated
cricket, simply emphasized the loneliness
and made the silence more profound. At
intervals, all nature seemed to heave a
deep sigh, and address itself to slumber
again.</p>

<p>In the house I heard the muffled sound
of the clock chime one, but whether it
was striking the half-hour or the hour I
could not tell. Then I heard the stealthy
tread of feet. Some one stumbled over a
stick of timber, and the noise was followed
by a smothered exclamation and a confused
murmur of voices. As the story-writers
say, I knew that the hour had
come. I could hear whisperings, and then
I saw a tall shadow steal from behind
Aunt Minervy's house, and heard it rap
gently on the door. I raised the gun,
pulled the hammer back, and let drive. A
stream of fire shot from the gun, accompanied
by a report that tore the silence to
atoms. I heard a sharp exclamation of
surprise, then the noise of running feet,
and off went the other barrel. In a moment
the Major and the Colonel opened on
the fugitives. I heard a loud cry of pain
from one, and, in the midst of it all, the
mustard-seed shot rattled on the plank
fence like hominy-snow on a tin roof.</p>

<p>The next instant I heard some one running
back in my direction, as if for dear
life. He knew the place apparently, for
he tried to go through the orchard, but
just before he reached the orchard fence,
he uttered a half-strangled cry of terror,
and then I heard him fall as heavily as if
he had dropped from the top of the house.</p>

<p>It was impossible to imagine what had
happened, and it was not until we had investigated
the matter that the cause of the
trouble was discovered. A wire clothes-line,
stretched across the yard, had caught
the would-be Ku-Klux under the chin, his
legs flew from under him, and he had a fall,
from the effects of which he did not recover
for a long time. He was a young
man about town, very well connected,
who had gone into the affair in a spirit of
mischief. We carried him into the house,
and administered to his hurts the best we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
could; Aunt Minervy Ann, be it said to
her credit, being more active in this direction
than any of us.</p>

<p>On the Tuesday following, the county
paper contained the news in a form that
remains to this day unique. It is hardly
necessary to say that it was from the pen
of Major Tumlin Perdue.</p>

<p>"Last Saturday afternoon our local editor
was informed by a prominent citizen
that if we would apply to Major Purdue
we would be put in possession of a very
interesting piece of news. Acting upon
this hint, ye local yesterday went to Major
Perdue, who, being in high good-humor,
wrote out the following with his own
hand:</p>

<p>"'Late Saturday night, while engaged
with a party of friends in searching for a
stray dog on my premises, I was surprised
to see four or five men climb over my
back fence and proceed toward my residence.
As my most intimate friends do
not visit me by climbing over my back
fence, I immediately deployed my party
in such a manner as to make the best of
a threatening situation. The skirmish
opened at my kitchen-door, with two
rounds from a howitzer. This demoralized
the enemy, who promptly retreated
the way they came. One of them, the
leader of the attacking party, carried away
with him two loads of mustard-seed shot,
delivered in the general neighborhood and
region of the coat-tails, which, being on a
level with the horizon, afforded as fair a
target as could be had in the dark. I understand
on good authority that Mr. Larry
Pulliam, one of our leading and deservedly
popular citizens, has had as much
as a quart of mustard-seed shot picked
from his carcass. Though hit in a vulnerable spot,
the wound is not mortal.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T.
Perdue</span>.'"</p>

<p>I did my best to have Mr. Pulliam's
name suppressed, but the Major would not
have it so.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he insisted; "the man has
insulted me behind my back, and he's got
to cut wood or put down the axe."</p>

<p>Naturally this free and easy card created
quite a sensation in Halcyondale and the
country round about. People knew what
it would mean if Major Perdue's name
had been used in such an off-hand manner
by Mr. Pulliam, and they naturally
supposed that a fracas would be the outcome.
Public expectation was on tiptoe,
and yet the whole town seemed to take
the Major's card humorously. Some of
the older citizens laughed until they could
hardly sit up, and even Mr. Pulliam's
friends caught the infection. Indeed, it
is said that Mr. Pulliam, himself, after the
first shock of surprise was over, paid the
Major's audacious humor the tribute of a
hearty laugh. When Mr. Pulliam appeared
in public, among the first men he
saw was Major Perdue. This was natural,
for the Major made it a point to be
on hand. He was not a ruffler, but he
thought it was his duty to give Mr. Pulliam
a fair opportunity to wreak vengeance
on him. If the boys about town
imagined that a row was to be the result
of this first meeting, they were mistaken.
Mr. Pulliam looked at the Major and
then began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Major Perdue," he said, "I'd a heap
rather you'd pull your shot-gun on me
than your pen."</p>

<p>And that ended the matter.</p>

<h2>THE SHIP OF STARS<br />
By A. T. Quiller-Couch<br />
(Q.)</h2>

<h3>XIV<br />
VOICES FROM THE SEA</h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-054.jpg" width="72" height="71" alt="B" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Before winter and the
long nights came round
again, Taffy had become
quite a clever carpenter.
From the first his quickness
fairly astonished the
Bryanite, who at the best was but a journeyman
and soon owned himself beaten.</p>

<p>"I doubt," said he, "if you'll ever
make so good a man as your father; but
you can't help making a better workman."
He added, with his eyes on the boy's
face, "There's one thing in which you
might copy 'em. He hasn't much of a
gift, <i>but he lays it 'pon the altar</i>."</p>

<p>By this time Taffy had resumed his lessons.
Every day he carried a book or two
in the satchel with his dinner, and read or
translated aloud while his father worked.
Two hours were allowed for this in the
morning, and again two in the afternoon.
Sometimes a day would be set apart during
which they talked nothing but Latin.
Difficulties in the text of their authors they
postponed until the evening, and worked
them out at home, after supper, with the
help of grammar and dictionary.</p>

<p>The boy was not unhappy, on the
whole; though for weeks together he
longed for sight of George Vyell, who
seemed to have vanished into space, or into
that limbo where his childhood lay like
a toy in a lumber-room. Taffy seldom
turned the key of that room. The stories
he imagined now were not about fairies
or heroes, but about himself. He wanted
to be a great man and astonish the world.
Just how the world was to be astonished
he did not clearly see, even in his dreams;
but the triumph, in whatever shape it came,
was to involve a new gown for his mother,
and for his father a whole library of books.</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond never went back to his
books now, except to help Taffy. The
Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews
was laid aside. "Some day!" he
told Humility. The Sunday congregation
had dwindled to a very few, mostly farm
people; Squire Moyle having threatened
to expel any tenant of his who dared to
set foot within the church.</p>

<p>In the autumn two things happened
which set Taffy wondering.</p>

<p>During the first three years at Nannizabuloe
old Mrs. Venning had regularly been
carried downstairs to dine with the family.
The sea-air (she said) had put new life into
her. But now she seldom moved from
her room, and Taffy seldom saw her except
at night, when&mdash;after the old childish custom&mdash;he
knocked at her door to wish her
pleasant dreams and pull up the weights of
the tall clock which stood by her bed's
head.</p>

<p>One night he asked, carelessly, "What
do you want with the clock? Lying here
you don't need to know the time; and its
ticking must keep you awake."</p>

<p>"So it does, child; but, bless you, I like
it."</p>

<p>"Like being kept awake?"</p>

<p>"Dear, yes! I have enough of rest and
quiet up here. You mind the litany I used
to say over to you?&mdash;Parson Kempthorne
taught it to us girls when I was in service
with him; 'twas made up, he said, by another
old Devonshire parson, years and
years ago&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>When I lie within my bed</p>
<p>Sick in heart and sick in head,</p>
<p>And with doubts discomforted,</p>
<p class="i2">Sweet Spirit, comfort me!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>When the house do sigh and weep&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That's it. You wouldn't think how quiet
it is up here all day. But at night, when
you're in bed and sleeping, all the house
begins to talk; little creakings of the furniture,
you know, and the wind in the
chimney, and sometimes the rain in the
gutters running&mdash;it's all talk to me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Mostly it's quite sociable too; but sometimes,
in rainy weather, the tune changes,
and then it's like some poor soul in bed
and sobbing to itself. That's when the
verse comes in:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"When the house do sigh and weep</p>
<p>And the world is drowned in sleep,</p>
<p>Yet my eyes the watch do keep,</p>
<p class="i4">Sweet Spirit, comfort me!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"And then the clock's ticking is a wonderful
comfort. <i>Tick-tack, tick-tack!</i> and I
think of you stretched asleep and happy
and growing up to be a man, and the
minutes running and trickling away to my
deliverance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Granny!"</p>

<p>"My dear, I'm as well off as most;
but that isn't saying I sha'n't be glad to
go and take the pain in my joints to a
better land. Before we came here, in militia-time,
I used to lie and listen for the
buglers, but now I've only the clock. No
more bugles for me, I suppose, till I hear
them blown on t'other side of Jordan."</p>

<p>Taffy remembered how he too had lain
and listened to the bugles; and with that
he suddenly saw his childhood, as it were
a small round globe set within a far larger
one and wrapped around with other folks'
thoughts. He kissed his grandmother and
went away wondering; and as he lay
down that night it still seemed wonderful
to him that she should have heard those
bugles, and more wonderful that night
after night for years she should have been
thinking of him while he slept, and he
never have guessed it.</p>

<p>One morning, some three weeks later,
he and his father were putting on their oilskins
before starting to work&mdash;for it had
been blowing hard through the night and
the gale was breaking up in floods of rain&mdash;when
they heard a voice hallooing in
the distance. Humility heard it too and
turned swiftly to Taffy. "Run upstairs,
dear. I expect it's someone sent from
Tresedder Farm; and if so, he'll want to
see your father alone."</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond frowned. "No," he
said; "the time is past for that."</p>

<p>A fist hammered on the door. Mr.
Raymond threw it open.</p>

<p>"Brigantine&mdash;on the sands&mdash;half a mile
this side of the lighthouse!" Taffy saw
across his father's shoulder a gleam of yellow
oilskins and a flapping sou-wester'
hat. The panting voice belonged to Sam
Udy&mdash;son of old Bill Udy&mdash;a laborer at
Tresedder.</p>

<p>"I'll go at once," said Mr. Raymond.
"Run you for the coast-guard."</p>

<p>The oilskins went by the window; the
side gate clashed to.</p>

<p>"Is it a wreck?" cried Taffy. "May
I go with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there may be a message to run
with."</p>

<p>From the edge of the towans, where
the ground dipped steeply to the long
beach, they saw the wreck, about a mile
up the coast and, as well as they could
judge, a hundred or a hundred-and-fifty
yards out. She lay almost on her beam-ends,
with the waves sweeping high across
her starboard quarter, and never less than
six ranks of ugly breakers between her and
dry land. A score of watchers&mdash;in the
distance they looked like emmets&mdash;were
gathered by the edge of the surf. But
the coast-guard had not arrived yet.</p>

<p>"The tide is ebbing, and the rocket will
reach. Can you see anyone aboard?"</p>

<p>Taffy spied through his hands, but could
see no one. His father set off running and
he followed, half-blinded by the rain, at
every fourth step foundering knee-deep in
loose sand or tripping in a rabbit hole.
They had covered three-fourths of the
distance when Mr. Raymond pulled up
and waved his hat as the coast-guard
carriage swept into view over a ridge to
the right and came plunging across the
main valley of the towans. It passed them
close&mdash;the horses fetlock-deep in sand,
with heads down and heaving, smoking
shoulders; the coast-guardsmen with keen
strong faces like heroes'&mdash;and the boy
longed to copy his father and send a cheer
after them as they went galloping by. But
something rose in his throat.</p>

<p>He ran after the carriage, and reached
the shore just as the first rocket shot singing
out toward the wreck. By this time
at least a hundred miners had gathered,
and between their legs he caught a glimpse
of two figures stretched at length on the
wet sand. He had never looked on a
dead body before. The faces of these
were hidden by the crowd; and he hung
about the fringe of it, dreading and yet
courting a sight of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>The first rocket was swept down the
wind to leeward of the wreck. The chief
officer judged his second beautifully and
the line fell clean across the vessel and all
but amidships. A figure started up from
the lee of the deckhouse and springing
into the main shrouds grasped it and made
it fast. The beach being too low for
them to work the cradle clear above the
breakers, the coast-guardsmen carried the
shore end of the line up the shelving cliff
and fixed it. Within ten minutes the cradle
was run out, and within twenty, the
first man came swinging shoreward.</p>

<p>Four men were brought ashore alive,
the captain last. The other two of the
crew of six lay on the sands, with Mr.
Raymond kneeling beside them. He had
covered their faces, and, still on his knees,
gave the order to lift them into the carriage.
Taffy noticed that he was obeyed
without demur or question. And there
flashed on his memory a gray morning,
not unlike this one, when he had missed
his father at breakfast: "He had been
called away suddenly," Humility had explained,
"and there would be no lessons
that day," and had kept the boy indoors
all the morning and busy with a netting-stitch
he had been bothering her to teach
him.</p>

<p>"Father," he asked as they followed
the cart, "does this often happen?"</p>

<p>"Your mother hasn't thought it well
for you to see these sights."</p>

<p>"Then it <i>has</i> happened often?"</p>

<p>"I have buried seventeen," said Mr.
Raymond.</p>

<p>That afternoon he showed Taffy their
graves. "I know the names of all but two.
The bodies have marks about them&mdash;tattooed,
you know&mdash;and that helps. And
I write to their relatives or friends, and
restore whatever small property may be
found on them. I have often wished to
put up some grave-stone, or a wooden
cross, with their names. I keep a book
and enter all particulars, and where each
is laid."</p>

<p>He went to his chest in the vestry and
took out the volume&mdash;a cheap account
book, ruled for figures. Taffy turned over
the pages.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 3rd. 187-. Brig "James and
Maria:" J. D., fair-haired, height 5 ft. 8
in., marked on chest with initials and cross
swords, tattooed, also anchor and coil of
rope on right fore-arm: large brown mole
on right shoulder-blade. Striped flannel
drawers: otherwise naked: no property of
any kind.</i></p>

<p><i>Ditto. Grown man, age 40 or thereabouts:
dark; iron gray beard; lovers' knot
tattooed on right fore-arm, with initials R. L.,
E. W., in the loops: clad in flannel
shirt, guernsey, trousers (blue sea-cloth),
socks (heather-mixture), all unmarked.
Silver chain in pocket, with free-mason's
token: a half-crown, a florin, and four-pence</i>&mdash;&mdash;and
so on. On the opposite
page were entered the full names and details
afterwards discovered, with notes of
the Vicar's correspondence, and position
of the grave.</p>

<p>"They ought to have grave-stones,"
said Mr. Raymond. "But as it is I can
only get about thirty shillings for the funeral
from the county rate. The balance
has come out of my pocket&mdash;from two to
three pounds for each. From the beginning
the squire refused to help to bury
sailors. He took the ground that it wasn't
a local claim."</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Taffy: for as he turned
the leaves his eye fell on this entry:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jan. 30th, 187-. S. S. "Rifleman" (all
hands). Cargo, China-clay: W. P., Age,
about eighteen, fair skin, reddish hair, short
and curled, height 5 ft. 10¾ in. Initials
tattooed on chest under a three-masted ship
and semi-circle of seven stars; clad in flannel
singlet and trousers (cloth): singlet
marked with same initial in red cotton:
pockets empty</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But he was in the navy!" cried Taffy,
with his finger on the entry.</p>

<p>"Which one? Yes, he was in the Navy.
You'll see it on the opposite page. He
deserted, poor boy, in Cork Harbor, and
shipped on board a tramp steamer as
donkey-man. She loaded at Fowey and
was wrecked on the voyage back. William
Pellow he was called; his mother
lives but ten miles up the coast; she never
heard of it until six weeks after."</p>

<p>"But we&mdash;I, I mean&mdash;knew him. He
was one of the sailor boys on Toby's van.
You remember their helping us with the
luggage at <i>Indian Queen's</i>? He showed
me his tattoo marks that day."</p>

<p>And again he saw his childhood as it
were set about with an enchanted hedge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
across which many voices would have
called to him, and some from near, but
all had hung muted and arrested.</p>

<p>The inquest on the two drowned sailors
was held next day at the <i>Fifteen Balls</i>,
down in Innis village. Later in the afternoon,
the four survivors walked up to the
church, headed by the Captain.</p>

<p>"We've been hearing," said the Captain,
"of your difficulties, sir: likewise
your kindness to other poor sea-faring
chaps. We have liked to make ye a
small offering for your church, but sixteen
shillings is all we can raise between us.
So we come to say that if you can put us
on to a job, why we're staying over the
funeral, and a day's work or more after
that won't hurt us one way or another."</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond led them to the chancel
and pointed out a new beam, on which
he and Jacky Pascoe had been working
a week past, and over which they had
been cudgelling their brains how to get
it lifted and fixed in place.</p>

<p>"I can send to one of the miners and
borrow a couple of ladders."</p>

<p>"Ladders? Lord love ye, sir, and begging
your pardon, we don't want ladders.
With a sling, Bill, hey?&mdash;and a couple of
tackles. You leave it to we, sir."</p>

<p>He went off to turn over the gear salved
from his vessel, and early next forenoon
had the apparatus rigged up and ready.
He was obliged to leave it at this point,
having been summoned across to Falmouth,
to report to his agents. His last
words before starting were addressed to
his crew. "I reckon you can fix it now,
boys. There's only one thing more, and
don't you forget it: any man that wants
to spit must go outside."</p>

<p>That afternoon Taffy learnt for the first
time what could be done with a few ropes
and pulleys. The seamen seemed to spin
ropes out of themselves like spiders. By
three o'clock the beam was hoisted and
fixed; and they broke off work to attend
their shipmates' funeral. After the funeral
they fell to, again, though more silently,
and before nightfall the beam shone with
a new coat of varnish.</p>

<p>They left early next morning, after a
good deal of handshaking, and Taffy
looked after them wistfully as they turned
to wave their caps and trudged away over
the rise toward the cross-roads. Away to
the left in the wintry sunshine, a speck of
scarlet caught his eye against the blue-gray
of the town. He watched it as it came
slowly toward him, and his heart leapt&mdash;yet
not quite as he had expected it to leap.</p>

<p>For it was George Vyell. George had
lately been promoted to "pink" and
made a gallant figure on his strapping
gray hunter. For the first time Taffy felt
ashamed of his working suit and would
have slipped back to the church. But
George had seen him, and pulled up.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said he.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Taffy; and, absurdly
enough, could find no more to say.</p>

<p>"How are you getting on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right." There was another
pause. "How's Honoria?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's all right. I'm riding over
there now; they meet at Tredinnis to-day."
He tapped his boot with his hunting
crop.</p>

<p>"Don't you have any lessons now?"
asked Taffy, after awhile.</p>

<p>"Dear me, yes; I've got a tutor. He's
no good at it. But what made you ask?"</p>

<p>Really Taffy could not tell. He had
asked merely for the sake of saying something.
George pulled out a gold watch.</p>

<p>"I must be getting on. Well, good-by!"</p>

<p>"Good-by!"</p>

<p>And that was all.</p>

<h3>XV<br />
TAFFY'S APPRENTICESHIP</h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-057.jpg" width="72" height="72" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">They could manage the
carpentering now. And
Jacky Pascoe, who in addition
to his other trades
was something of a glazier,
had taken the damaged
east window in hand. For six months
it had remained boarded up, darkening
the chancel. Mr. Raymond removed the
boards and fixed them up again on the
outside, and the Bryanite worked behind
them night after night. He could only be
spied upon through two lancet windows
at the west end of the church, and these
they curtained.</p>

<p>But what continually bothered them
was their ignorance of iron-work. Staples,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
rivets, hinges were for ever wanted. At
length, one evening toward the end of
March, the Bryanite laid down his tools.</p>

<p>"Tell 'ee what 'tis, Parson. You must
send the boy to someone that'll teach 'er
smithy-work. There's no sense in this cold
hammering."</p>

<p>"Wheelwright Hocken holds his shop
and cottage from the Squire."</p>

<p>"Why not put the boy to Mendarva the
Smith, over to Benny Beneath? He's a
first-rate workman."</p>

<p>"That is more than six miles away."</p>

<p>"No matter for that. There's Joll's
Farm close by; Farmer Joll would board
and lodge 'en for nine shilling a week, and
glad of the chance; and he could come
home for Sundays."</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond, as soon as he reached
home, sat down and wrote a letter to
Mendarva the Smith and another to Farmer
Joll. Within a week the bargains
were struck, and it was settled that Taffy
should go at once.</p>

<p>"I may be calling before long, to look
you up," said the Bryanite, "but mind you
do no more than nod when you see me."</p>

<p>Joll's Farm lay somewhere near Carwithiel,
across the moor where Taffy had
gone fishing with George and Honoria.
On the Monday morning when he stepped
through the white front gate, with his bag
on his shoulder, and paused for a good
look at the building, it seemed to him a
very comfortable farmstead, and vastly superior
to the tumble-down farms around
Nannizabuloe. The flagged path, which
led up to the front door between great
bunches of purple honesty, was swept as
clean as a dairy.</p>

<p>A dark-haired maid opened the door
and led him to the great kitchen at the
back. Hams wrapped in paper hung from
the rafters, and strings of onions. The
pans over the fireplace were bright as mirrors,
and through the open window he
heard the voices of children at play as well
as the clacking of poultry in the town-place.</p>

<p>"I'll go and tell the mistress," said the
maid; but she paused at the door. "I
suppose you don't remember me, now?"</p>

<p>"No," said Taffy, truthfully.</p>

<p>"My name's Lizzie Pezzack. You was
with the young lady, that day, when she
bought my doll. I mind you quite well.
But I put my hair up last Easter, and that
makes a difference."</p>

<p>"Why, you were only a child."</p>

<p>"I was seventeen last week. And&mdash;I
say, do you know the Bryanite, over to
Innis?&mdash;Preacher Jacky Pascoe?"</p>

<p>He nodded, remembering the caution
given him.</p>

<p>"I got salvation off him. Master and
mis'ess, they've got salvation too; but
they take it very quiet. They're very
fond of one another; if you please one
you'll please both. They let me walk
over to prayer-meetin' once a week. But
I don't go by Mendarva's shop&mdash;that's
where you work&mdash;though 'tis the shortest
way; because there's a woman buried in
the road there, with a stake through her,
and I'm a terrible coward for ghosts."</p>

<p>She paused as if expecting him to say
something; but Taffy was staring at a
"neck" of corn, elaborately plaited, which
hung above the mantle-shelf. And just
then Mrs. Joll entered the kitchen.</p>

<p>Taffy&mdash;without any reason&mdash;had expected
to see a middle-aged house-wife.
But Mrs. Joll was hardly over thirty; a
shapely woman, with a plain, pleasant face
and auburn hair, the wealth of which she
concealed by wearing it drawn straight
back from the forehead and plaited in the
severest coil behind. She shook hands.</p>

<p>"You'll like a drink of milk before I
show you your room?"</p>

<p>Taffy was grateful for the milk. While
he drank it, the voices of the children outside
rose suddenly to shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>"That will be their father come home,"
said Mrs. Joll and going to the side-door
called to him. "John, put the children
down; Mr. Raymond's son is here."</p>

<p>Mr. Joll, who had been galloping round
the farmyard with a small girl of three on
his back, and a boy of six tugging at his
coat-tails, pulled up, and wiped his good-natured
face.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," said he, coming
forward and shaking hands, while the two
children stared at Taffy.</p>

<p>After a minute, the boy said, "My name's
Bob. Come and play horses, too."</p>

<p>Farmer Joll looked at Taffy shyly.
"Shall we?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Raymond will be tired enough
already," his wife suggested.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," declared Taffy; and hoisting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Bob on his back, he set off furiously
prancing after the farmer.</p>

<p>By dinner-time he and the family were
fast friends, and after dinner the farmer
took him off to be introduced to Mendarva
the Smith.</p>

<p>Mendarva's forge stood on a triangle
of turf beside the high-road, where a cart-track
branched off to descend to Joll's
Farm in the valley. And Mendarva was
a dark giant of a man with a beard like
those you see on the statues of Nineveh.
On Sundays he parted his beard carefully
and tied the ends with little bows of scarlet
ribbon; but on week days it curled at
will over his mighty chest. He had one
assistant whom he called "the Dane;" a
red-haired youth as tall as himself and
straighter from the waist down. Mendarva's
knees had come together with
years of poising and swinging his great
hammer.</p>

<p>"He's little, but he'll grow," said he,
after eying Taffy up and down. "Dane,
come fore and tell me if we'll make a
workman of 'en."</p>

<p>The Dane stepped forward and passed
his hands over the boy's shoulders and
down his ribs. "He's slight, but he'll fill
out. Good pair o' shoulders. Give's
hold o' your hand, my son."</p>

<p>Taffy obeyed; not very well liking to
be handled thus.</p>

<p>"Hand like a lady's. Tidy wrist,
though. He'll do, master."</p>

<p>So Taffy was passed, given a leathern
apron, and set to his first task of keeping
the forge-fire raked and the bellows going,
while the hammers took up the music he
was to listen to for a year to come.</p>

<p>This music kept the day merry; and beyond
the window along the bright high-road
there was usually something worth
seeing&mdash;farm-carts, jowters' carts, the
doctor and his gig, pedlars and Johnny-fortnights,
the miller's wagons from the
valley-bottom below Joll's Farm, and on
Tuesdays and Fridays, the market van
going and returning. Mendarva knew or
speculated upon everybody, and, with half
the passers-by, broke off work and passed
the time of day, leaning on his hammer.
But down at the farm all was strangely
quiet, in spite of the children's voices;
and at night the quietness positively kept
Taffy awake, listening to the pur-r of the
pigeons in their cote against the house-wall,
thinking of his grandmother awake
at home and listening to the <i>tick-tack</i> of
her tall clock. Often when he woke to
the early summer daybreak and saw
through his attic-window the gray shadows
of the sheep, still and long, on the slope
above the farmstead, his ear was wanting
something, asking for something; for the
murmur of the sea never reached this inland
valley. And he would lie and long
for the chirruping of the two children in
the next room and the drawing of bolts
and clatter of milk-pails below stairs.</p>

<p>He had a plenty to eat, and that plenty
simple and good; and clean linen to sleep
between. The kitchen was his, except on
Saturday nights, when Mrs. Joll and Lizzie
tubbed the children there; and then
he would carry his books off to the best
parlor, or stroll around the farm with Mr.
Joll and discuss the stock. There were
no loose rails in Mr. Joll's gates, no farm
implements lying out in the weather to
rust. Mr. Joll worked early and late,
and his shoulders had a tell-tale stoop&mdash;for
he was a man in the prime of life, perhaps
some five years older than his wife.</p>

<p>One Saturday evening he unburdened
his heart to Taffy. It happened at the
end of the hay-harvest, and the two were
leaning over a gate discussing the yet unthatched
rick.</p>

<p>"What I say is," declared the farmer,
quite inconsequently, "a man must be able
to lay his troubles 'pon the Lord. I don't
mean his work, but his troubles; and go
home and shut the door and be happy
with his wife and children. Now I tell
you that for months&mdash;iss, years&mdash;after
Bob was born, I kept plaguing mysel' in
the fields, thinking that some harm might
have happened to the child. Why, I used
to make an excuse and creep home, and
then if I see'd a blind pulled down, you
wouldn't think how my heart'd go thump;
and I'd stand wi' my hand on the door-hapse
an' say, 'If so be the Lord have
took'n, I must go and comfort Susan&mdash;not
my will but Thine, Lord&mdash;but, Lord,
don't 'ee be cruel this time!' And then
find the cheeld right as ninepence and the
blind only pulled down to keep the sun
off the carpet! After awhile my wife
guessed what was wrong&mdash;I used to make
up such poor twiddling pretences. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
said, 'Look here, the Lord and me'll see
after Bob; and if you can't keep to your
own work without poking your nose into
ours, then I married for worse and not for
better.' Then it came upon me that by
leaving the Lord to look after my job I'd
been treating Him like a farm-laborer.
It's the things you can't help He looks
after&mdash;not the work."</p>

<p>A few evenings later there came a knock
at the door, and Lizzie, who went to open
it, returned with the Bryanite skipping behind her.</p>

<p>"Blessings be upon this here house!"
he cried, cutting a sort of double-shuffle
on the threshold. He shook hands with
the farmer and his wife, and nodded toward
Taffy. "So you've got Parson Raymond's
boy here!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Joll; and turned to
Taffy. "He've come to pray a bit; perhaps
you would rather be in the parlor?"</p>

<p>Taffy asked to be allowed to stay; and
presently Mr. Pascoe had them all down
on their knees. He began by invoking
God's protection on the household;
but his prayer soon ceased to be a prayer.
It broke into ejaculations of praise&mdash;"Friends,
I be too happy to ask for
anything&mdash;Glory, glory! The blood!
The precious blood! O deliverance! O
streams of redemption running!" The
farmer and his wife began to chime in&mdash;"Hallelujah!"
"Glory!" and Lizzie Pezzack
to sob. Taffy, kneeling before a
kitchen chair, peeped between his palms
and saw her shoulders heaving.</p>

<p>The Bryanite sprang to his feet, over-turning
the settle with a crash. "Tid'n no
use. I must skip. Who'll dance wi' me?"</p>

<p>He held out his hands to Mrs. Joll.
She took them, and skipped once shamefacedly.
Lizzie, with flaming cheeks,
pushed her aside. "Leave me try, mis'ess;
I shall die if I don't." She caught the
preacher's hands, and the two leapt about
the kitchen. "I can dance higher than
mis'ess! I can dance higher than mis'ess!"
Farmer Joll looked on with a dazed face.
"Hallelujah!" "Amen!" he said at intervals,
quite mechanically. The pair stood
under the bacon rank and began to whirl
like dervishes&mdash;hands clasped, toes together,
bodies leaning back and almost
rigid. They whirled until Taffy's brain
whirled with them.</p>

<p>With a louder sob, Lizzie let go her
hold, and tottered back into a chair, laughing
hysterically. The Bryanite leaned
against the table, panting.</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Mrs. Joll took
a napkin from the dresser and fell to fanning
the girl's face, then to slapping it
briskly. "Get up and lay the table," she
commanded; "the preacher'll stay to
supper."</p>

<p>"Thank 'ee, ma'am, I don't care if I
do," said he; and ten minutes latter they
were all seated at supper and discussing
the fall in wheat in the most matter-of-fact
voices. Only their faces twitched,
now and again.</p>

<p>"I hear you had the preacher down to
Joll's last night," said Mendarva the
Smith. "What'st think of 'en?"</p>

<p>"I can't make him out," was Taffy's
colorless but truthful answer.</p>

<p>"He's a bellows of a man. I do hear
he's heating up th' old Squire Moyle's
soul, to knack an angel out of 'en. He'll
find that a job and a half. You mark my
words, there'll be Hamlet's ghost over in
your parish one o' these days."</p>

<p>During work-hours Mendarva bestowed
most of his talk on Taffy. The Dane
seldom opened his lips, except to join in
the Anvil Chorus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Here goes one&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Sing, sing, Johnny!</p>
<p>Here goes two&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Sing, Johnny, sing!</p>
<p>Whack'n till he's red</p>
<p>Whack'n till he's dead</p>
<p>And whop! goes the widow with a brand new ring!</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>and when the boy took a hammer and
joined in, he fell silent. Taffy soon observed
that a singular friendship knit these
two men, who were both unmarried. Mendarva
had been a famous wrestler in his
day, and his great ambition now was to
train the other to win the County belt.
Often, after work, the pair would try a
hitch together on the triangle of turf, with
Taffy for stickler; Mendarva illustrating
and explaining, the Dane nodding seriously
whenever he understood, but never
answering a word. Afterwards the boy
recalled these bouts very vividly&mdash;the
clear evening sky, the shoulders of the
two big men shining against the level sun
as they gripped and swayed, their long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
shadows on the grass under which (as he
remembered) the poor self-murdered woman
lay buried.</p>

<p>He thought of her at night, sometimes,
as he worked alone at the forge: for
Mendarva allowed him the keys and use
of the smithy overtime, in consideration
of a small payment for coal, and then he
blew his fire and hammered with a couple
of candles on the bench and a Homer
between them; and beat the long hexameters
into his memory. The incongruity
of it never struck him. He was
going to be a great man, and somehow
this was going to be the way. These
scraps of iron&mdash;these tools of his forging&mdash;were
to grow into the arms and shield
of Achilles. In its own time would come
the magic moment, the shield find its true
circumference and swing to the balance
of his arm, proof and complete.</p>

<h3>XVI<br />
LIZZIE AND HONORIA</h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-061.jpg" width="71" height="72" alt="H" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">His apprenticeship lasted a
year and six months, and
all this while he lived with
the Jolls, walking home
every Sunday morning and
returning every Sunday
night, rain or shine. He carried his deftness
of hand into his new trade, and it was Mendarva
who begged and obtained an extension
of the time agreed on. "Rather than
lose the boy I'll tache 'en for love." So
Taffy stayed on for another six months.</p>

<p>He was now in his seventeenth year&mdash;a
boy no longer. One evening, as he blew
up his smithy fire, the glow of it fell on the
form of a woman standing just outside the
window and watching him. He had no
silly fears of ghosts; but the thought of
the buried woman flashed across his mind
and he dropped his pincers with a clatter.</p>

<p>"'Tis only me," said the woman. "You
needn't to be afeared." And he saw it was
the girl Lizzie.</p>

<p>She stepped inside the forge and seated
herself on the Dane's anvil.</p>

<p>"I was walking back from prayer-meeting,"
she said. "'Tis nigher this way, but
I don't ever dare to come. Might, I dessay,
if I'd somebody to see me home."</p>

<p>"Ghosts?" asked Taffy, picking up
the pincers and thrusting the bar back into
the hot cinders.</p>

<p>"I dunno; I gets frightened o' the very
shadows on the road sometimes. I suppose,
now, you never walks out that way?"</p>

<p>"Which way?"</p>

<p>"Why, toward where your home is.
That's the way I comes."</p>

<p>"No, I don't." Taffy blew at the cinders
until they glowed again. "It's only
on Sundays I go over there."</p>

<p>"That's a pity," said Lizzie, candidly.
"I'm kept in, Sunday evenings, to look
after the children while farmer and mis'ess
goes to Chapel. That's the agreement I
came 'pon."</p>

<p>Taffy nodded.</p>

<p>"It would be nice now, wouldn't it&mdash;"
She broke off, clasping her knees and
staring at the blaze.</p>

<p>"What would be nice?"</p>

<p>Lizzie laughed confusedly. "Aw, you
make me say 't. I can't abear any of the
young men up to the Chapel. If me and
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Taffy ceased blowing. The fire died
down and in the darkness he could hear
her breathing hard.</p>

<p>"They're so rough," she went on, "And
t'other night I met young Squire Vyell
riding along the road, and he stopped me
and wanted to kiss me."</p>

<p>"George Vyell? Surely he didn't?"
Taffy blew up the fire again.</p>

<p>"Iss he did. I don't see why not,
neither."</p>

<p>"Why he shouldn't kiss you?"</p>

<p>"Why he shouldn't want to."</p>

<p>Taffy frowned, carried the white hot bar
to his anvil and began to hammer. He
despised girls, as a rule, and their ways.
Decidedly Lizzie annoyed him: and yet
as he worked he could not help glancing
at her now and then, as she sat and
watched him. By and by he saw that her
eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't walk home alone. I'm
afeared."</p>

<p>He tossed his hammer aside, raked out
the fire, and reached his coat off its peg.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
As he swung round in the darkness to put
it on, he blundered against Lizzie or Lizzie
blundered against him. She clutched at
him nervously.</p>

<p>"Clumsy! can't you see the doorway?"</p>

<p>She passed out, and he followed and
locked the door. As they crossed the turf
to the highroad, she slipped her arm into
his. "I feel safe, that way. Let it stay,
co!" After a few paces, she added,
"You're different from the others&mdash;that's
why I like you."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I dunno; but you <i>be</i> diff'rent. You
don't think about girls, for one thing."</p>

<p>Taffy did not answer. He felt angry,
ashamed, uncomfortable. He did not turn
once to look at her face, dimly visible by
the light of the young moon&mdash;the Hunter's
moon&mdash;now sinking over the slope of
the hill. Thick dust&mdash;too thick for the
heavy dew to lay&mdash;covered the cart-track
down to the farm, muffling their footsteps.
Lizzie paused by the gate.</p>

<p>"Best go in separate," she said;
paused again and whispered, "You may,
if you like."</p>

<p>"May do what?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what young Squire Vyell
wanted."</p>

<p>They were face to face now. She held
up her lips, and as she did so, they parted
in an amorous murmurous little laugh.
The moonlight was on her face. Taffy
bent swiftly and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Oh, you hurt!" With another little
laugh, she slipped up the garden-path and
into the house.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Taffy followed, hating
himself.</p>

<p class="p2">For the next fortnight he avoided her;
and then, late one evening, she came
again. He was prepared for this, and had
locked the door of the smithy and let down
the shutter while he worked. She tapped
upon the outside of the shutter with her
knuckles.</p>

<p>"Let me in!"</p>

<p>"Can't you leave me alone?" he answered,
pettishly. "I want to work, and
you interrupt."</p>

<p>"I don't want no love-making&mdash;I don't
indeed. I'll sit quiet as a mouse. But I'm
afeared, out here."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"I'm afeared o' the ghost. There's
something comin'&mdash;let me in, co!"</p>

<p>Taffy unlocked the door and held it half
open while he listened.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's somebody coming, on
horseback. Now, look here&mdash;it's no
ghost, and I can't have you about here,
with people passing. I&mdash;I don't want you
here at all; so make haste and slip away
home&mdash;that's a good girl."</p>

<p>Lizzie glided like a shadow into the dark
lane as the trample of hoofs drew close,
and the rider pulled up beside the door.</p>

<p>"You're working late, I see. Is it too
late to make a shoe for Aide-de-camp
here?"</p>

<p>It was Honoria. She dismounted and
stood in the doorway, holding her horse's
bridle.</p>

<p>"No," said Taffy; "that is, if you
don't mind the waiting."</p>

<p>With his leathern apron he wiped the
Dane's anvil for a seat, while she hitched
up Aide-de-camp and stepped into the
glow of the forge-fire.</p>

<p>"The hounds took us six miles beyond
Carwithiel: and there, just as they
lost, Aide-de-camp cast his off-hind shoe.
I didn't find it out at first, and now I've
had to walk him all the way back. Are
you alone here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who was that I saw leaving as I came
up?"</p>

<p>"You saw someone?"</p>

<p>"Yes." She nodded, looking him
straight in the face. "It looked like a
woman. Who was she?"</p>

<p>"That was Lizzie Pezzack, the girl who
sold you her doll, once. She's a servant
down at the farm where I lodge."</p>

<p>Honoria said no more for the moment,
but seated herself on the Dane's
anvil, while Taffy chose a bar of iron and
stepped out to examine Aide-de-camp's
hoof. He returned and in silence began
to blow up the fire.</p>

<p>"I dare say you were astonished to see
me," she remarked at length.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'm still forbidden to speak to you.
The last time I did it, grandfather beat me."</p>

<p>"The old brute!" Taffy nipped the
hot iron savagely in his pincers.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he'll do it again. Somehow
I don't think he will."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>Taffy looked at her. She had drawn
herself up, and was smiling. In her close
riding-habit she seemed very slight, yet
tall, and a woman grown. He took the
bar to the anvil and began to beat it flat.
His teeth were shut, and with every blow
he said to himself "Brute!"</p>

<p>"That's beautiful," Honoria went on.
"I stopped Mendarva, the other day, and
he told me wonders about you. He says
he tried you with a hard-boiled egg and
you swung the hammer and chipped the
shell all round without bruising the white
a bit. Is that true?"</p>

<p>Taffy nodded.</p>

<p>"And your learning&mdash;the Latin and
Greek, I mean; do you still go on with
it?"</p>

<p>He nodded again, toward a volume of
Euripides that lay open on the work-bench.</p>

<p>"And the stories you used to tell
George and me; do you go on telling
them to yourself?"</p>

<p>He was obliged to confess that he never
did. She sat for awhile watching the
sparks as they flew. Then she said, "I
should like to hear you tell one again.
That one about Aslog and Orm, who ran
away by night across the ice-fields and
took a boat and came to an island with a
house on it, and found a table spread and
the fire lit, but no inhabitants anywhere&mdash;You
remember? It began 'Once upon
a time, not far from the city of Drontheim,
there lived a rich man&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>Taffy considered a moment and began
"Once upon a time, not far from the city
of Drontheim&mdash;&mdash;" He paused, eyed
the horse-shoe cooling between the pincers,
and shook his head. It was no use.
Apollo had been too long in service with
Admetus, and the tale would not come.</p>

<p>"At any rate," Honoria persisted,
"you can tell me something out of your
books: something you have just been
reading."</p>

<p>So he began to tell her the story of Ion,
and managed well enough in describing
the boy and how he ministered before
the shrine at Delphi, sweeping the temple
and scaring the birds away from the precincts;
but when he came to the plot of
the play and, looking up, caught Honoria's
eyes, it suddenly occurred to him
that all the rest of the story was a sensual
one and he could not tell it to her. He
blushed, faltered, and finally broke down.</p>

<p>"But it was beautiful," said she, "so far
as it went; and it's just what I wanted.
I shall remember that boy Ion now, whenever
I think of you helping your father in
the church at home. If the rest of the
story is not nice, I don't want to hear it."</p>

<p>How had she guessed? It was delicious,
at any rate, to know that she thought
of him, and Taffy felt how delicious it
was, while he fitted and hammered the
shoe on Aide-de-camp's hoof, she standing
by with a candle in either hand, the
flame scarcely quivering in the windless
night.</p>

<p>When all was done, she raised a foot
for him to give her a mount. "Good-night!"
she called, shaking the reins.
Taffy stood by the door of the forge, listening
to the echoes of Aide-de-camp's
canter, and the palm of his hand tingled
where her foot had rested.</p>

<h3>XVII<br />
THE SQUIRE'S WEIRD</h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-063.jpg" width="71" height="72" alt="H" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">He took leave of Mendarva
and the Jolls just before
Christmas. The smith was
unaffectedly sorry to lose
him. "But," said he, "the
Dane will be entered for
the Championship next summer, so I
s'pose I must look forward to that."</p>

<p>Everyone in the Joll household gave
him a small present on his leaving. Lizzie's
was a New Testament, with her name
on the fly-leaf, and under it "Converted,
April 19, 187-." Taffy did not want the
gift, but took it rather than hurt her feelings.</p>

<p>Farmer Joll said, "Well, wish 'ee well!
Been pretty comfiable, I hope. Now
you'm goin', I don't mind telling 'ee I
didn't like your coming a bit. But now 'tis
wunnerful to me you've been wi' us less'n
two year'; we've made such progress."</p>

<p>At home Taffy bought a small forge
and set it up in the church, at the west
end of the north aisle. Mr. Raymond, under
his direction, had been purchasing the
necessary tools for some months past; and
now the main expense was the cost of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
coal, which pinched them a little. But
they managed to keep the fire alight, and
the work went forward briskly. Save that
he still forbade the parish to lend them
the least help, the old Squire had ceased
to interfere.</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond's hair was grayer; and
Taffy might have observed&mdash;but did not&mdash;how
readily, toward the close of a day's
laborious carpentry, he would drop work
and turn to Dindorf 's <i>Poetæ Scenici Græci</i>,
through which they were reading their
way. On Sundays, the congregation rarely
numbered a dozen. It seemed that as the
end of the Vicar's task drew nearer, so the
prospect of filling the church receded and
became more shadowy. And if his was a
queer plight, Jacky Pascoe's was a queerer.
The Bryanite continued to come by night
and help, but at rarer intervals. He was
discomforted in mind, as anyone could
see; and at length he took Mr. Raymond
aside and made confession.</p>

<p>"I must go away; that's what 'tis. My
burden is too great for me to bear."</p>

<p>"Why," said Mr. Raymond, who had
grown surprisingly tolerant during the
past twelve months, "what cause have
you, of all men, to feel dejected? You
can set the folk here on fire like flax."
He sighed.</p>

<p>"That's azackly the reason&mdash;I can set
'em afire with a breath; but I can't hold
'em under. I make 'em too strong for
me&mdash;<i>and I'm afeard</i>. Parson, dear, it's
the gospel truth; for two years I've a
been strivin' agen myself, wrastlin' upon
my knees, and all to hold this parish in."
He mopped his face. "'Tis like fightin'
with beasts at Ephesus," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you want to hold them in?"</p>

<p>"I do and I don't. I've got to try,
anyway. Sometimes I tell mysel' 'tis putting
a hand to the plough and turning
back; and then I reckon I'll go on. But
when the time comes, I can't. I'm
afeard, I tell 'ee." He paused. "I've
laid it before the Lord, but He don't seem
to help. There's two voices inside o' me.
'Tis a terrible responsibility."</p>

<p>"But the people, what are you afraid
of their doing?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. You don't know what
a runaway hoss will do, but you're afeard
all the same." He sank his voice. "There's
wantonness, for one thing&mdash;six love-children
born in the parish this year, and
more coming. They do say that Vashti
Clemow destroyed her child. And Old
Man Johns&mdash;him they found dead on the
rocks under the Island&mdash;he didn't go there
by accident. 'Twas a calm day, too."</p>

<p>As often as not Taffy worked late&mdash;sometimes
until midnight&mdash;and blew his
forge-fire alone in the church, the tap of
his hammer making hollow music in the
desolate aisles. He was working thus one
windy night in February, when the door
rattled open and in walked a totally unexpected
visitor&mdash;Sir Harry Vyell.</p>

<p>"Good-evening! I was riding by and
saw your light in the windows dancing up
and down. I thought I would hitch up
the mare and drop in for a chat. But go
on with your work."</p>

<p>Taffy wondered what had brought him
so far from his home at that time of night,
but asked no questions. And Sir Harry
placed a hassock on one of the belfry
steps and, taking his seat, watched for
awhile in silence. He wore his long riding
boots and an overcoat with the collar
turned up about a neck-cloth less nattily
folded than usual.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said at length, "that my
boy George was clever like you. You
were great friends once&mdash;you remember
Plymouth, hey? But I dare say you've
not seen much of each other lately."</p>

<p>Taffy shook his head.</p>

<p>"George is a bit wild. Oxford might
have done something for him; made a
man of him, I mean. But he wouldn't
go. I believe in wild oats to a certain
extent. I have told him from the first he
must look after himself and decide for
himself. That's my theory. It makes a
youngster self-reliant. He goes and comes
as he likes. If he comes home late from
hunting, I ask no questions; I don't wait
dinner. Don't you agree with me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Taffy answered, wondering
why he should be consulted.</p>

<p>"Self-reliance is what a man wants."</p>

<p>"Couldn't he have learnt that at
school?"</p>

<p>Sir Harry fidgeted with the riding-crop
in his hands. "Well, you see, he's an
only son&mdash;&mdash;. I dare say it was selfish
of me. You don't mind my talking about
George?"</p>

<p>Taffy laughed. "I like it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Harry laughed too, in an embarrassed
way. "But you don't suppose I
rode over from Carwithiel for that?
You're not so far wrong, though. The
fact is&mdash;one gets foolish as one grows old&mdash;George
went out hunting this morning,
and didn't turn up for dinner. I kept to
my rule, and dined alone. Nine o'clock
came; half-past; no George. At ten
Hoskings locked up as usual, and off I
went to bed. But I couldn't sleep. After
awhile, it struck me that he might be
sleeping here over at Tredinnis; that is,
if no accident had happened. No sleep
for me until I made sure; so I jumped
out, dressed, slipped down to the stables,
saddled the mare and rode over. I left
the mare by Tredinnis great gates and
crept down to Moyle's stables like a house-breaker;
looked in through the window,
and, sure enough, there was George's gray
in the loose box to the right. So George
is sleeping there, and I'm easy in my
mind. No doubt you think me an old
fool?"</p>

<p>But Taffy was not thinking anything of
the sort.</p>

<p>"I couldn't wish better than that. You
understand?" said Sir Harry, slyly.</p>

<p>"Not quite."</p>

<p>"He lost his mother early. He wants
a woman to look after him, and for him to
think about. If he and Honoria would
only make up a match.... And
Carwithiel would be quite a different
house."</p>

<p>Taffy hesitated, with a hand on the
forge-bellows.</p>

<p>"I dare say it's news to you, what I'm
telling. But it has been in my mind this
long while. Why don't you blow up
the fire? I bet Miss Honoria has thought
of it too; girls are deep. She has a head
on her shoulders. I'll warrant she'd send
half a dozen of my servants packing within
a week. As it is, they rob me to a
stair. I know it, and I haven't the pluck
to interfere."</p>

<p>"What does the old Squire say?"
Taffy managed to ask.</p>

<p>"It has never come to <i>saying</i> anything.
But I believe he thinks of it, too, when
he happens to think of anything but his
soul. He'll be pleased; everyone will be
pleased. The properties touch, you see."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, he's failing fast.
This religion of his is a symptom; all of
his family have taken to it in the end. If
he hadn't the constitution of a horse, he'd
have been converted ten years before this.
What puzzles me is, he's so quiet. You
mark my words"&mdash;Sir Harry rose, buttoned
his coat and shook his riding-crop
prophetically&mdash;"he's brewing up for
something. There'll be the devil of a flare-up
before he has done."</p>

<p class="p2">It came with the midsummer bonfires.
At nine o'clock on St. John's Eve, Mr.
Raymond read prayers in the church. It
was his rule to celebrate thus the vigils of
all saints in the English calendar and some
few Cornish saints besides; and he regularly
announced these services on the
preceding Sundays; but no parishioner
dreamed of attending them.</p>

<p>To-night, as usual, he and Taffy had
prayed alone; and the lad was standing
after service at the church door, with his
surplice on his arm (for he always wore a
surplice and read the lessons on these
vigils), when the flame of the first bonfire
shot up from the headland over Innis
village.</p>

<p>Almost on the moment a flame answered
it from the point where the lighthouse
stood; and within ten minutes the horizon
of the towans was cressetted with these
beacon-fires; surely (thought Taffy) with
many more than usual. And he remembered
that Jacky Pascoe had thrown out
a hint of a great revival to be held on
Baal-fire Night (as he had called it).</p>

<p>The night was sultry and all but windless.
For once the tormented sands had rest.
The flame of the bonfires shone yellow&mdash;orange-yellow&mdash;and
steady. He could
see the dark figures of men and women
passing between him and the nearest, on
the high wastrel in front of Tredinnis
great gates. Their voices reached him
in a confused murmur, broken now and
then by a child's scream of delight. And
yet a hush seemed to hang over sea and
land: an expectant hush. For weeks the
sky had not rained. Day after day, a dull
indigo blue possessed it, deepening with
night into duller purple, as if the whole
heavens were gathering into one big
thunder-cloud, which menaced but never
broke. And in the hush of those nights a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
listener could almost fancy he heard, between
whiles, the rabbits stirring uneasily
in their burrows.</p>

<p>By and by, the bonfire on the wastrel
appeared to be giving out specks of light,
which blazed independently; yet without
decreasing its own volume of flame. The
sparks came dancing, nearer and larger;
the voices grew more distinct. The spectators
had kindled torches and were
advancing in procession to visit other
bonfires. The torches, too, were supposed
to bless the fields they passed across.</p>

<p>The procession rose and sank as it came
over the uneven ridges like a fiery snake;
topped the nearest ridge and came pouring
down past the churchyard wall. At
its head danced Lizzie Pezzack, shrieking
like a creature possessed, her hair loose
and streaming, while she whirled her
torch. Taffy knew these torches; bundles
of canvas steeped in tar and fastened
in the middle to a stout stick or piece of
chain. Lizzie's was fastened to a chain,
and as he watched her uplifted arm swinging
the blazing mass he found time to
wonder how she escaped setting her hair
on fire. Other torch-bearers tossed their
arms and shouted as they passed. The
smoke was suffocating, and across the
patch of quiet graveyard the heat smote
on Taffy's face. But in the crowd he saw
two figures clearly&mdash;Jacky Pascoe and
Squire Moyle; and the Bryanite's face
was agitated and white in the glare. He
had given an arm to the Squire, who was
clearly the centre of the procession, and
tottered forward with jaws working and
cavernous eyes.</p>

<p>"He's saved!" a voice shouted.</p>

<p>Others took up the cry. "Saved!"
"The Squire's saved!" "Saved to-night&mdash;saved
to glory!"</p>

<p>The Squire paused, still leaning on the
Bryanite's arm. While the procession
swayed around him, he gazed across the
gate, as a man who had lost his bearings.
No glint of torchlight reached his eyes;
but the sight of Mr. Raymond's surpliced
figure, standing behind Taffy's shoulders
in the full glare, seemed to rouse him. He
lifted a fist and shook it slowly.</p>

<p>"Com'st along, sir!" urged the Bryanite.</p>

<p>But the Squire stood irresolute, muttering
to himself.</p>

<p>"Com'st along, sir!"</p>

<p>"Lev' me be, I tell 'ee!" He laid
both hands on the gate and spoke across it
to Mr. Raymond, his head nodding while
his voice rose.</p>

<p>"D'ee hear what they say? I'm saved.
I'm the Squire of this parish, and I'm going
to Heaven. I make no account of you
and your church. Old Satan's the fellow
I'm after, and I'm going to have him out
o' this parish to-night or my name's not
Squire Moyle."</p>

<p>"That's of it, Squire!" "Hunt' en!"
"Out with 'en!"</p>

<p>He turned on the shouting throng.</p>

<p>"Hunt 'en? Iss fay I will! Come
along, boys&mdash;back to Tredinnis! No,
no"&mdash;this to the Bryanite&mdash;"we'll go back.
I'll show 'ee sport, to-night&mdash;we'll hunt
th'ould Divvle by scent and view. I'm
Squire Moyle, ain't I? And I've a pack
o' hounds, ha'n't I? Back, boys&mdash;back,
I tell 'ee!"</p>

<p>Lizzie Pezzack swung her torch. "Back&mdash;back
to Tredennis!" The crowd took
up the cry, "Back to Tredinnis!" The
old man shook off the Bryanite's hand, and
as the procession wheeled and re-formed
itself confusedly, rushed to the head of it,
waving his hat&mdash;</p>

<p>"Back!&mdash;Back to Tredinnis!"</p>

<p>"God help them," said Mr. Raymond;
and taking Taffy by the arm, drew him
back into the church.</p>

<p class="p2">The shouting died away up the road.
For three-quarters of an hour father and
son worked in silence. The reddened sky
shed its glow gently through the clear glass
windows, suffusing the shadows beneath
the arched roof. And, in the silence, the
lad wondered what was happening up at
Tredinnis.</p>

<p class="p2">Jim the Whip took oath afterward that
it was no fault of his. He had suspected
three of the hounds for a day or two&mdash;Chorister,
White, Boy, and Bellman&mdash;and
had separated them from the pack. That
very evening he had done the same with
Rifler, who was chewing at the straw in a
queer fashion and seemed quarrelsome.
He had said nothing to the Squire, whose
temper had been ugly for a week past. He
had hoped it was a false alarm&mdash;had
thought it better to wait, and so on.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>The Squire went down to the Kennels
with a lantern, Jim shivering behind him.
They had their horses saddled outside and
ready; and the crowd was waiting along
the drive and up by the great gates.
The Squire saw at a glance that two
couples were missing, and in two seconds
had their names on his tongue. He was
like a madman. He shouted to Jim to
open the doors. "Better not, maister!"
pleaded Jim. The old man cursed, smote
him across the neck with the butt-end of
his whip, and unlocked the doors himself.
Jim, though half-stunned, staggered forward
to prevent him, and took another
blow which felled him. He dropped
across the threshold of Chorister's kennel,
the doors of all opened outwards, and the
weight of his body kept this one shut.
But he saw the other three hounds run
out&mdash;saw the Squire turn with a ghastly
face, drop the lantern and run for it as
White Boy snapped at his boot. Jim
heard the crash of the lantern and the snap
of teeth, and with that he fainted off in the
darkness. He had cut his forehead against
the bars of the big kennel, and when he
came to himself, one of the hounds was
licking his face through the grating.</p>

<p class="p2">Men told for years' after how the old
Squire came up the drive that night, hoof
to belly; his chin almost on mare Nonesuch's
neck; his face like a man's who
hears hell cracking behind him; and of
the three dusky hounds which followed
(the tale said) with clapping jaws and
eyes like coach-lamps.</p>

<p class="p2">Down in the quiet church Taffy heard
the outcry, and, laying down his plane,
looked up and saw that his father had
heard it too. His mild eyes, shining
through his spectacles, asked, as plainly as
words: "What was <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>For a minute&mdash;two minutes&mdash;they
heard nothing more. Then out of the
silence broke a rapid, muffled beat of
hoofs; and Mr. Raymond clutched Taffy's
arm as a yell&mdash;a cry not human, or if
human, insane&mdash;cut the night like a knife
and fetched them to their feet. Taffy
gained the porch first, and just at that
moment a black shadow heaved itself on
the churchyard wall and came hurling
over with a thud&mdash;a clatter of dropping
stones&mdash;then a groan.</p>

<p>Before they could grasp what was happening,
the old Squire had extricated
himself from the fallen mare, and came
staggering across the graves.</p>

<p>"Hide me!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He came with both arms outstretched,
his face turned sideways. Behind him,
from the far side of the wall, came sounds&mdash;horrible
shuffling sounds, and in the
dusk they saw the head of one of the
hounds above the coping and his fore-paws
clinging as he strained to heave
himself over.</p>

<p>"Save me! Save&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They caught him by both arms, dragged
him within and slammed the door.</p>

<p>"Save!&mdash;&mdash;sa&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The word ended with a thud as he
pitched headlong on the slate pavement.
Through the barred door, the scream of
the mare Nonesuch answered it.</p>

<h2>The Foreign Mail Service at New York<br />
By E. G. Chat</h2>

<p>"Steamer's mail!!!" This loud
call, echoing throughout the foreign
room in the Post-office Building, is
the equivalent of the "Clear ship for action"
on the man-of-war. Instantly
distributors leave their separating cases,
stampers abandon their "blocks," the electric
stamp-cancelling machine temporarily
ceases its humming, buzzing rattle, every
available clerk or porter gets ready for the
fray, and the whole force charges with
alacrity on the fast accumulating pile, as
sack after sack is dumped on a low, large
table, at times entirely hid from sight by
bags with labels indicating their origin,
thousands of miles away, whether from the
confines of Siberia, or the shores of the
Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>The sight, even to men familiar with
the work, is inspiring, especially when at
times two, and on certain occasions three,
steamers land their cargo of sacks at the
same hour. Not infrequently this happens
when some one thousand and odd
sacks have to be made ready for an outgoing
steamer, and then the foreign force
is fairly on its mettle, and may well be
compared again to the crew of a battle-ship
when it has to fight fire inside and
fire from the enemy outside. Here again,
as on the battle-ship, organization and
years' training tell. The wagon-loads of
sacks melt before the vigorous and steady
onslaught as did the Spanish fleet before
Dewey's guns, and in a short while the
room is cleared and the "field-day" over.

</div>

<p>It would be difficult, in this great cosmopolitan
city of New York, to find a
person who does not make use of this foreign
service, yet strange to relate is the
fact that, outside of the clerks immediately
handling these mails, hardly anyone
can be found who knows, or even has the
slightest idea of the International Postal
Union system. Perhaps this is accounted
for by the comparatively very recent establishment
of said system, and its growth
so immediate and rapid that the public
has not so far "caught up" with it.</p>

<p>The system was aptly described by
Postmaster-General Gary at the opening
of the Washington Postal Congress, in
1897, as "one of the grandest projects
of the century." No other agency is responsible
to such an extent for the tremendous
expansion of great ideals and
the exchange of views between nations
characteristic of the last quarter of this
century.</p>

<p>Previous to 1875, when the Treaty of
Bern, assented to and ratified by twenty-two
nations, took effect, the exchange of
mails between separate nationalities was
done under such difficulties, and subject
to delays and mishaps of so many kinds,
that a normal growth and improvement
in keeping with the progress of civilization
was out of the question. In 1840 the
foreign mail from England for the United
States, carried on the Great Western, consisted
of two sacks of mail. As late as
1873 a steamer from Europe with 20,000
letters on board was considered a record
breaker. To-day the Cunard steamers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
and other transatlantic ships carrying what
is called a "full European mail," usually
bring some two hundred thousand letters,
and an average of three hundred sacks of
newspapers and printed matter for New
York City, not to mention the five hundred
and odd sacks for Canada, Mexico,
and transpacific countries, and a few
United States exchange offices, which
are now taken direct to the trains and not
handled at the New York office.</p>

<p>The working unit of the International
Postal Union system is the "Exchange
Office." Each postal administration selects
these despatching and receiving
centres according to quantity of mail
handled at any particular point. In European
countries many of these offices
are on trains from one important point to
another, and are called Travelling Exchange
offices. They receive and despatch
mails in the same manner as offices
located in large cities. There are also
exchange offices located on steamship
lines, and they are called Sea Post-offices.
No matter where located, these offices all
conduct business on the same lines, and
handle mail in the same manner throughout
the world. The rules and regulations
of this service are adopted by Postal Congresses,
meeting about every six years
and under the general supervision of the
International Bureau of the Postal Union
located at Bern, Switzerland, and supported
by funds from all governments
represented in the Union according to the
respective importance of their mail service.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-070" id="i-070"></a>
<img src="images/i-070.jpg" width="265" height="419" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Transferring Mails from an Ocean Greyhound to the Post-office Boat, Postmaster General, through the Chutes.</p>
</div>

<p>Only through these exchange offices can
correspondence go from one country to another,
as no other offices are provided with
the clerical force and system necessary to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
the handling of international mails. It is
at times difficult to explain to business
people that a North German Lloyd steamer
calling at Gibraltar and Naples will carry
mail for Naples only, and that a letter addressed
to Gibraltar by that particular
steamer cannot be delivered at that port,
but will be carried all the way to Naples,
whence it will be re-despatched to Gibraltar
through a more or less circuitous route.
This is because Gibraltar is not an "exchange
office" with New York, and
"closed mails" are not sent thereto from
New York. A "closed mail," as the name
indicates, is a mail duly tied up, sealed,
and labelled with the name of the exchange
office to which it is sent, and not
to be opened until it gets there, passing
sometimes through four or five countries
before reaching its destination. No other
kind of mails is carried by steamers, yet
the answer will often be made to inquiries,
that a certain letter would have been
sent "in open mail" to London or elsewhere.
This does not mean that the mail
in which the letter in question would be
sent is despatched "opened," but that it
is sent in the "closed" mail for London,
there to be opened and disposed of by
the London clerks, just as if it had been
mailed in London. This course is followed
with all correspondence for offices
abroad, or even entire countries, which is
not in sufficient quantity to justify the
establishment of an exchange; and the
mails for these offices or countries is sent
to the foreign exchange office with the
best facilities for disposing of it. Thus
mail for Liberia will be sent sometimes to
Hamburg, Germany, and at other times
to Liverpool, England.</p>

<p>A closed mail consists of ordinary letters,
printed matter, and other articles, and of
registered articles. Sometimes all these
elements will be enclosed in the same sack,
or they may be despatched in separate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
sacks, when in sufficient quantity. The
registered mail is tied up and sealed in
distinctive red-striped sacks, and then these
sacks are enclosed in ordinary mail-sacks,
tied up and labelled in exactly the same
manner as the sacks containing ordinary
letters, so that it is impossible to tell from
the outside which sack contains registered
matter. A mail may consist of one sack
only, containing all classes of correspondence,
or it may be composed of a large
number of sacks. In either case it is accompanied
by a letter bill, enclosed in one
of the sacks. This letter bill is one of a
series beginning on January 1st of each
year, being numbered with consecutive
numbers to each foreign exchange office.
Thus when Naples receives a mail from
New York containing the letter bill numbered
65, and the previous mail received at
that office had Letter Bill No. 63, Naples
knows that mail with Letter Bill No. 64
is missing, and immediately notifies New
York of the fact in a form called "Bulletin
of Verification." This form is in use
for official correspondence between all
offices in the Postal Union regarding
irregularities of all sorts discovered in the
mails of one office for another. A record
of the number of each mail and the particulars
of its despatch being kept by each
office, the inquiry from Naples in the
above instance would immediately be investigated,
and that office notified that the
missing mail had been sent on such a date,
by such a steamer, etc.; or, if more was
known concerning its fate, as in the case
of the mails sent per La Bourgogne last
July, mention would be made of the fact.
The Russian travelling exchange office
of Kibarty to St. Petersburg frequently
receives the mails sent from this office
every Wednesday in inverted order, that
is, the mail sent by a fast White Star liner
at noon on Wednesday, may be received
a few hours ahead of the mail sent by a
slower American line steamer which sailed
at 10 <span class="s08">A.M.</span> on the same day. The occurrence
is so often repeated that one would
think it would go unnoticed, and the Russian
office would wait a few hours anyway
before notifying New York that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
mail is missing, but such is not the case,
and the bulletin "Your mail No. &mdash;&mdash; is
missing," is immediately sent to New
York, followed next day by another bulletin,
"Your mail No. &mdash;&mdash; has arrived."
At the New York office the first bulletin
is always held until receipt of the second,
which is sure to follow and renders investigation
unnecessary; they are called
"Katie didn't," and "Katie did." Many
bulletins are received subsequent to the
holidays with best wishes for Christmas
or New Year from one office to another.
They are mostly all in English, French, or
Spanish, and are, at times, more or less
humorous, if not pathetic, as was one received
from Martinique about the time
Cervera's ill-fated fleet was hovering near
that island. A mail from New York had
just been received at St. Pierre, and in
one of the sacks the horrified
French Director of Posts had
found a cat in the last stages
of decomposition. He had
sent for the American Consul
to view the remains, and his
bulletin to the New York office
regarding this irregularity was
a model of official French. It
stated how the smell of that
dead cat had penetrated every
corner of his office, and one
could read between the lines
that he suspected the whole
affair to be a joke played upon
him by the Yankee postal
clerks. The event was duly investigated in
the New York office, but beyond the fact
that one member of the numerous pussy
tribe in the mail building was missing, little
else could be positively ascertained. That
the cat could have been sent in that bag
as a joke was not to be thought of for an
instant, but it was presumed that in its
wandering among the piles of mail-sacks
in the basement, pussy had found the
sack for Martinique awaiting to be sealed,
and had concluded to take a nap therein.
The sack was probably tied up and sealed
soon afterward, and the unwilling stow-away
had been sent to the steamer. Later
on it was reported by the purser of the
steamer that he suspected there was something
alive in one of the mail-bags, but
such is the respect for postal seals that he
never thought to open the sack in the presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
of witnesses and release the animal.
Thrown in the mail-room with other sacks
on top of it, there could be no doubt that
poor pussy had been smothered before
passing the Hook, and his condition when
landed at Martinique must have been such
as to fully justify and explain the ill-disguised
indignation of the French officials.</p>

<p class="caption">In the Newspaper Division.</p>
<p class="caption">Throwing papers into boxes for all parts of the world.</p>
</div>

<p>The letter bill describes minutely the
mail it accompanies, states how many sacks
of letters, how many sacks of papers, and
how many articles registered, describing
each registered article separately, except in
cases of heavy registered mails, when a separate
descriptive list is sent in addition to
the letter bill. Thus it is easy for the office
of destination to verify the mail it receives
and ascertain whether any is missing.</p>

<p>Small closed mails are at times enclosed
inside of closed mails for other offices; for
instance, the mails made up at Paris for
Guatemala are in a sack duly sealed and
labelled as aforesaid, but this sack is put
inside of one of the bags for the New
York office, and in such cases the fact is
noted on the letter bill sent with the New
York mail.</p>

<p>The business of the foreign clerks when
a foreign mail is received in the manner described
in our first lines is to open promptly
every sack received, inspect and dispose
of contents, and report to the chief clerk
the result from each sack thus opened.
Each clerk takes hold of one of the sacks
piled on the table, and throws it on another
table used for opening the mails. He
cuts open the fastenings, keeping the label
separate, and also the letter-bill, if he happens
to find it in the sack; if several classes
of mail matter are found therein, he pushes
the ordinary letters over to one side,
sweeps the newspapers into large four-wheeled
baskets near by, takes to another
place the smaller enclosed mails addressed
to other offices, and lays the registered sack
on the chief clerk's desk, where a man
from the registry division will receive it
and give a receipt for it. The clerk then
calls out to the chief clerk the result of
his examination, "Lisbon-Reg.-Bill and 1
Honolulu"&mdash;which means that in the sack
just opened he found the mail from Lisbon
for New York with the letter-bill, registered
articles and a smaller closed mail for
Honolulu. Like the rattle of musketry
these calls are fired at the chief clerk, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
marks everything on a tally-sheet, which
will later on be compared with the advices
received from the foreign offices on each
letter-bill; and if any discrepancy is found
it will be investigated, resulting in a bulletin
of verification to office of origin, or in
something worse for the foreign clerk who
made an erroneous announcement of the
contents, if the fault is laid to him. In a
few minutes, sometimes an hour or more,
an entire mail is opened and the room
cleared, the registry man getting away to
his department with all the registered mails,
and the newspaper force wheeling away
the baskets full of newspapers and packages.
The letters are then divided into
four parts&mdash;those for New York City proper,
those for the rest of the United States
and Canada, those for foreign countries
which have been sent in open mail to New
York, and those which are unpaid or partially
prepaid. Many foreign offices make
a separation of the mails for New York
City from those for other places, but this is
a matter of accommodation and reciprocal
arrangements between exchange offices;
and the work of separation is, strictly
speaking, that of the foreign clerks in any
office. The newspapers are treated in the
same manner as the letters. All city mail
is then sent to the city department for final
distribution and delivery, and that for other
parts of the United States and Canada is
sent to the domestic mail division for despatch.
All letters and mail addressed to
other countries are retained in the foreign
division, and included in the next mail for
these countries. The unpaid and short-paid
mail is "rated up" before delivery to
other divisions. This mail is put up under
distinctive labels. The despatching
offices have marked on each article the
amount of deficiency in prepayment. No
matter where originating, this amount is
marked in French money (centimes). The
letter "T" (initial of French word "tax")
is also stamped on covers. The foreign
clerks at the receiving office calculate, in
the money of their country, the amount
of deficiency and double it up, stamping
this charge on the covers for collection by
office of delivery.</p>

<p class="caption">Despatching clerk, on the left, tallying off mails, sack by sack. Foreign mails are delivered to trucks sent by the Steamship
Companies and are receipted for at the door of New York Post Office.</p>
</div>

<p>This work, and also that of separating
New York mail and mail for the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
States and cities, is done by the sea post-offices
in steamers of the North German
Lloyd, Hamburg-American, and American
Lines; and when mails are received by
either of these steamers they are ready for
delivery in a much shorter time than when
received by other vessels. In addition to
the sea post-office service, the transfer service
has also in the last two or three years
materially reduced the work at the foreign
department in the New York office.</p>

<p>No sooner has the "ticker" reported
the Campania or other big liner "off
Fire Island" than a veteran of the
transportation department, accompanied by a
few clerks and porters, hastens to the foot
of Cortlandt Street and boards the
Postmaster-General, the flag-ship of the
post-office fleet. The boat was built for this
service, and is equipped with spacious
mail-rooms, chutes for transboarding
sacks, and other expediting appliances.
Steam is up, and she is off down the
bay to meet the big steamer. She makes
fast to her sides, and the mails are received
aboard through the chutes, while the
clerks check and verify the number received
on a sort of invoice called "way bill," prepared
by the London, Havre, or sea post-office.
Frequently the passengers are
still awaiting the quarantine doctor while
the mails are speeding on their way to the
Battery, where the New York City sacks
are landed; then to the Pennsylvania
Railroad, then to the foot of Forty-second
Street, where wagons await the mails for
the Grand Central Depot. Thus a great
saving in time is often made, while formerly
the whole mail went first to the docks
of the several transatlantic lines, then by
wagons to the General Post-Office, then
again by wagons to the different depots.
When the mails are handled by sea post-offices
during the sea-trip, they generally
arrive ready for the trains, and little but
what is for New York City proper comes
to the general office; but the large and
heavy mails on the Cunard and White
Star Lines, also on the French Line, are
not thus assorted, and fully two-thirds has
to come to the foreign division to be
handled as previously described.</p>

<p>We have explained to a great extent so
far what seems to pertain to the incoming
mails only; but we said at the start that
the foreign mail is worked throughout the
world in every exchange office very much
after the same pattern, and it will now be
easier to explain the handling of mail going
from the United States to other countries.
There are in the United States several exchange
offices besides New York, but, with
the exception of New Orleans and San
Francisco, the mails they make up consist
only of matter originating at each of these
offices. Mail for some of the Central
American republics is sent to New Orleans,
and mail for transpacific countries goes
mostly to San Francisco. All other mail,
no matter where dropped in the letter-box,
comes to the New York office through the
instrumentality of the Railway Mail Service.
Letters for abroad are tied up in bundles,
and labelled "New York Foreign."
Some of the railway mail offices make a
preliminary separation by countries, and
many bundles reach New York labelled
"Russia," "Switzerland," etc.; but as
there are many exchange offices in these
foreign countries, these bundles have again
to be opened at New York, and assorted,
although this first separation facilitates the
process. The bundles are cut open, and
the letters are all passed through the electric
machine or stamped by hand, the
"back-stamp" thus impressed showing
their date of arrival in New York.</p>

<p>This is not done with letters originating
in New York City, the date and time of
mailing being in that case shown in the
stamp-mark cancelling the postage-stamps,
and being held sufficient for records. The
mail having been "back-stamped," goes
on a low shelf in front of each distributor,
and is then assorted according to destination.
The "separating case" consists of
nine rows of boxes, ten boxes in each row.
Many of the boxes bear the names of exchange
offices in Europe or those reached
by steamers for Europe. There are also
boxes for other parts of the world, in which
letters are deposited to be later on taken
to another special "separating case" for
these countries. In each separating case
there is a box where unpaid or short-paid
letters are deposited. A special clerk takes
them out, weighs them, marks thereon the
deficient postage, and stamps them "T,"
when they are assorted on a separate case
and tied up in bundles under labels indicating
that the contents of the bundles consist
of short-paid mail. They go in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
sacks as ordinary letters. When a box bearing
the name of an exchange office is full
(about one hundred and fifty letters), the
contents are taken out, divided into two
parts, the largest letters being laid across
both parts, and the whole is tied up in a sheet
of strong manila paper. String is not spared
in this process, and so securely and strongly
are these packages tied that they have been
known to remain in the water for days and
weeks at times, and when found, with the
exception of the top letters and the edges,
they were yet in a condition to permit delivery
to persons for whom they were intended.
Many people, no doubt, some weeks
after the Elbe disaster, remember having
received letters with a paster attached,
stating that the letter had been found in
the North Sea, in a bag originating in Norway
and sunk with the Elbe. This was the
only sack of mail ever recovered from that
steamer. The same was true of the mail
recovered from the Oregon, sacks being
found far down the Jersey coast days after
the wreck of that steamer, and forwarded
to New York, where, after being dried, most
of the letters were found to be deliverable.</p>

<p>The package thus wrapped and tied is
labelled with the printed name of the exchange
office for which its contents are
intended, and thrown into a large basket.
When the basket is full, it is wheeled over
to the pouching rack, an iron frame divided
into sections, each section bearing
the name of an exchange office, and provided
with four hooks which hold open
a mail sack. The pouching clerk takes
the packages of letters, reads the labels
thereon, and throws them into the proper
sack. When full (about seventy-five
pounds), the sack is taken down and ready
for tying and sealing up. The last sack
taken down receives the letter-bill for the
exchange office of destination. The sack
is tied, and a label bearing the name of
the office for which it is destined is
inserted in the string. After several turns have
been taken, both ends of the string are
passed through the holes at the bottom of
a small tin cup which is subsequently filled
with hot wax, so that the string cannot be
removed without its being cut open (<a href="#i-078">see
illustration on page 71)</a>. In this country
labels made of good Holland linen are
used fresh for each sack. In other countries
other material is employed, some
using leather, some wood, some strong
cardboard. The return of labels of any
value is generally requested, and they are
used over and over until worn out. Great
Britain does not use labels of any kind,
but has the address of each sack stencilled
on the sack itself, thus: "London for
New York." This, of course, renders the
sack useless for any other service. In the
United States the labels are white for
letter sacks, buff for papers, and cardinal
red for registered mails.</p>

<p>The newspapers are assorted in the basement
of the Post-office, very much in the
same fashion as letters, but they are not
tied up in bundles. The separating cases
into which they are thrown are so made
that a sack hanging at the lower end of the
box receives the mail thrown therein, and
when full, it is ready for tying, labelling,
and sealing up. In this department are
received the queerest odds and ends going
through the mails to foreign countries,
newspapers especially being selected
to hide in their folds sundry articles of
every description sent to friends "in the
auld country." Jewelry, from the penny
kind to really valuable articles, handkerchiefs
galore, baby's dressing outfits, rattlesnake
skins, plugs of tobacco, cucumbers&mdash;these
and many other curios of every description
are found and stopped. If the address
of the sender appears on the package,
it is returned to him direct. Otherwise
it goes to the Dead Letter Office, where
it is kept a certain length of time awaiting
to be claimed. The unclaimed part is
finally sold at auction.</p>

<p>In the letter department there are also
curiosities, but of another kind. The greatest
part of the letters addressed to Santa
Claus in Greenland, or other Northern
lands, are treated by the foreign clerks.
There are also many mysteries to be unravelled
in the queer hieroglyphics which are supposed
to be the addresses of letters, especially
those going to Russia, Turkey,
Hungary, and even Italy. Clerks of
the foreign department are not linguists;
but the same characters recurring so constantly
soon appear familiar, and they experience
no trouble in "boxing" the letters
to the proper office.</p>

<p>When a mail has closed, no more letters
or papers are put in the assorting boxes,
but everything that was there is taken out,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
tied, labelled, and sacked. The letter-bills
are then prepared, and after all the
sacks are sealed the way-bills are made up
in duplicate copies. A full European mail
<i>via</i> Queenstown or <i>via</i> Southampton
averages nine to twelve hundred sacks,
fully two-thirds of which have been made
up in the New York office. The way-bill
describes this large mail only as so
many letter-sacks and so many paper-sacks
from the New York office, or the
Chicago, or other office of origin, for
Paris, or for Dublin, etc., and when the
steamers land the mail at its port of arrival,
the way-bills are used to check and verify
the number of sacks landed. One copy
of the way-bill is returned to New York
with a receipt from the official at the port of
destination, and the responsibility of this
office for the mails ceases. Their further
transportation will be the business of the
administration which has received them.</p>

<p>The Parcels Post system is also taken
care of by the clerks of the foreign
department, but as it is a system based on
special conventions or agreements between
any two countries, it is not within
the sphere of an article relating to the
international mail service as regulated by
the Postal Union Conventions. The
exchange of large parcels, however, as
well as of ordinary correspondence, is one
of the improvements which remain for
future postal congresses to introduce in
the system. At present, the United States
parcels' post exchange is confined to the
West Indies, Central America, Mexico,
Hawaii, and Newfoundland. Ordinary
merchandise not exceeding eleven pounds
can be forwarded under that system for
twelve cents a pound.</p>

<p>The general supervision over all American
exchange offices is centred in the Office
of Foreign Mails, in Washington, but
the fact that over ninety per cent. of foreign
mail matter is handled, or passes
through the New York office would make
exceedingly advantageous, especially for
business interests all over the country, the
transfer to New York of the supreme direction
of that service. Many times questions
have to be decided and steps taken
at short notice, delay being the great bugaboo
of postal officials, and in such cases
constant and daily touch with a system
ever increasing and improving would be
of incalculable benefit. The New York
force, however, is so well trained, its
superintendents and clerks are so completely
acquainted with every detail of the system,
that so far the business world has not
suffered from the present arrangement. It
certainly has not gained. A flattering
testimonial of this efficiency of the New York
foreign force is found in a report to his
government of the New Zealand Postal
Agent residing at San Francisco and in
charge of the important British-Australian
Mail Service. "I find," says he, "that the
New York officials are extremely anxious
to make the best connections and are
indefatigable in their efforts to expedite
the transfer of mails. Messrs. Maze and
Boyle,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Superintendent and Assistant
Superintendent of mails in New York City,
are particularly energetic and watchful,
and no stone is left unturned at that office
to further our interests in that direction,
and the mails are often transferred to tugs
and sent after the Atlantic liners when
late."</p>

<h2>DANIEL WEBSTER<br />
<span class="s09">WITH   UNPUBLISHED   MANUSCRIPTS AND   SOME   EXAMPLES   OF
HIS   PREPARATION   FOR   PUBLIC   SPEAKING</span><br />
By George F. Hoar</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-081.jpg" width="72" height="73" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">In one respect Daniel Webster
is the most striking figure
in our history, and one
of the few most striking
figures in all history. That
is, in the impression he
made on everybody&mdash;that, great as were
his achievements, he was himself greater
than his greatest achievement.</p>

<p>Franklin, Webster, and Emerson are
the three great New Englanders. Each
of them was a great public teacher. If
Webster did not lack, at least he did not
manifest, Franklin's wonderful common-sense,
as applied to common things and
common life. He had not Emerson's profound
spiritual discernment or wonderful
poetic instinct. But his intellect seems
like a vast quarry. When you have excavated
the great rocks at the surface, you
know there is an inexhaustible supply left.
When he died, the people felt as if the
corner-stone of the Capitol had been removed;
as if the elephant had died that
bore the universe on its back.</p>

<p>Emerson's portraiture of Webster at
Bunker Hill is made up of a few strokes.
But it reveals the whole secret. Great as
were the things that Webster said, profound
as was his reasoning, lofty as are the
flights of his imagination, stirring as are
his appeals to the profoundest passions of
his countrymen, there is a constant feeling
that Jove is behind these thunderbolts.
That is the contrast between him and so
many other orators. Even in Choate and
Phillips you are admiring the phrase and
the elocution, and not the men. In Webster
you are thinking of the man, and not
the phrases. The best things that he said
do not seem to his listener to be superior,
and rarely seem to his listener to be equal,
to the man who said them. There is plenty
of reserve power behind&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>... Half his strength he put not forth, but checked<br />
His thunder in mid-volley.</p>
</div>

<p>Emerson also said of him, "His strength
was like the falling of a planet; his discretion,
the return of its due and perfect
curve."</p>

<p>Nothing certainly can be more profitable
for youth who desire to cultivate the
capacity for public speaking for the purpose
of addressing juries, legislative bodies,
or popular assemblies, than the study of
the style, the delivery, and the method of
preparation of him whom nearly all his
countrymen think the foremost American
orator, and whom many of them think the
foremost orator who ever spoke the English
tongue. Many admirable critics have
dealt with these topics.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Winthrop has told,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in his own delightful
way, the story of one of Webster's
compositions, famous at the time, now
almost forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. Winthrop says also truly of Daniel
Webster:</p>

<p>"Daniel Webster, unlike Everett or
Choate, was all deliberation, both in matter
and manner. I do not believe that
it ever occurred to him what gestures he
should make, or that he ever remembered
what gestures he had made. His words
seemed to flow spontaneously and often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
slowly, whether from his lips or his pen, as
from a profound and exhaustless reservoir
of thought. Of him it might be, and perhaps
often has been, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"... Deep on his front engraven<br />
Deliberation sat, and public care."</p>
</div>

<p>He says of Webster's eloquence that it
was the eloquence of clear, cogent argument,
and of occasional deep emotion,
expressed in clear, forcible Saxon words&mdash;sometimes
adorned by most felicitous
quotations and sometimes by magnificent
and matchless metaphors.</p>

<p>James Parton says:</p>

<p>"He discovered, he says, that the value
as well as the force of a sentence depends
chiefly upon its meaning, not its language,
and that great writing is that in
which much is said in a few words, and
those words the simplest that will answer
the purpose. Having made this notable
discovery, he became a great eraser of
adjectives, and toiled after simplicity and
directness."</p>

<p>Edward Everett, who knew Mr. Webster
very intimately, says:</p>

<p>"Perhaps the noblest bursts&mdash;the loftiest
flights, the last and warmest tints of
his discourses of this kind&mdash;were the unpremeditated
inspiration of the moment
of delivery."</p>

<p>I suppose, from all I can gather, that
Mr. Webster, with very few exceptions
indeed, committed to writing nothing
but the heads of his speeches. But they
were, nearly all of them, upon subjects
constantly in his thoughts. He had undoubtedly
matured sentences and phrases
which came to his mind in leisure moments,
and which came to his memory
under the stimulant of great occasions
and great audiences, in addressing juries
or public assemblies or the Senate, with
which he ornamented his discourses, or
strengthened his argument. Most of the
speeches we have only as they came to
us in the imperfect reporting of the
time. Some of them, like the oration at
Plymouth, he probably revised carefully
before they were published. We have his
own testimony that this was true of the
well-known "morning drum-beat" passage
in the speech on the President's Protest.</p>

<p>Still, the testimony is abundant that
some of his best passages must have come
from an inspiration while he was upon his
feet. Mr. Winthrop gives an account
of one; Mellen Chamberlain, a most accomplished
critic and observer, another.
And there are plenty of others floating
about. Judge Chamberlain says one
thing of him, which I dare say may have
been said before and since. It explains
Webster's influence over his auditors and
over posterity. He says:</p>

<p>"He was perfectly sane, and it may be
the most perfectly sane orator who ever
spoke English."</p>

<p class="p2">I have in my possession a good many
of Mr. Webster's manuscripts, including
his preparations for speeches, letters from
him to intimate friends and from his intimate
friends to him, a good many bound
volumes of political pamphlets, some of
them with the autographs of famous authors,
and some of his books. From
these I select a few which relate to important
and interesting events in his life,
or throw some additional light upon his
habit and method of preparation for public
speaking, adding some explanation and
comment.</p>

<p>One of the greatest debates in our parliamentary
history, only surpassed in importance
in Mr. Webster's public life by
the debate with Hayne on Foot's Resolution
and the debate on the Compromise
measures in March, 1850, is the debate
on the Sub-Treasury in the early part of
the year 1838. Silas Wright introduced
the Sub-Treasury Bill January 16, 1838.
January 30, 1838, the bill came on for a
second reading, and Mr. Wright made an
elaborate speech in its support. The next
day Mr. Webster spoke. His speech,
which is wholly a reply to Wright, makes
no allusion whatever to Mr. Calhoun. It
is reported in the fourth volume of his
works, page 432. I have before me Mr.
Webster's notes of preparation for that
speech. They constitute a mere brief, all
included on six pages of letter-paper, and
mostly consisting of mere catch-words.
The first sentence or two, however, indicate
the difference between Webster and
the supporters of the Sub-Treasury:</p>

<p>"Let the government attend to its own
business; and let the people attend to
theirs."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>"Let the government take care of the
currency for its own revenue; for all other
purposes, let it leave it to the States and
to the people."</p>

<p>"Ominous and disheartening sentences.
Yet the whole spirit of the Administration
and of this bill."</p>

<p>There is no hint in these notes, except the
above, of any of the eloquent and weighty
sentences with which the speech abounds.</p>

<p>February 15, 1838, Mr. Calhoun spoke
on the Independent Treasury Bill. (See,
for this speech, his Works, vol. 3, page
202.) He makes an allusion to one of
Mr. Webster's arguments, viz., his claim
that the government should furnish paper
currency. But the speech contains nothing
personal or calculated to excite challenge
and reply. March 10, 1838, Calhoun
makes a second speech on the same
bill (reported, Works, vol. 3, page 244).
That speech, also, contains hardly any
allusion to Mr. Webster. It is devoted
almost wholly to a reply to Clay, between
whom and Calhoun a very angry personal
altercation had arisen. March 12,
1838, Mr. Webster delivered his second
speech on the Sub-Treasury, which is reported
in his Works, vol. 4, page 424.
It occupies seventy-six pages there. Of
this, the last thirty-three are a reply to
Mr. Calhoun. Calhoun said in his answer,
which was made on the 22d of the
same month, that Webster delivered this
part of his speech with great vehemence,
and evidently considered it the most important
portion of his remarks. So much
of the speech as is a reply to Mr. Calhoun,
however, deals chiefly with a speech
made by him at the extra session in September,
1837, and with a letter known as
the "Edgefield Letter," written by Mr.
Calhoun to his constituents in the vacation.
I have Mr. Webster's entire preparation
for this speech. It is in Webster's
handwriting, and consists of eight
heads, all on one page of a sheet of small
note-paper, labelled on the back, in Webster's
handwriting, "Heads of my speech
on the Sub-Treasury," and is as follows:</p>

<p>"No. 1. General state of the country
and credit system."</p>

<p>"No. 2. Our pecuniary condition and
question of excess."</p>

<p>"No. 3. Is the measure suited to the
condition of the country?"</p>

<p>"No. 4. Is it a just exercise of our
powers?"</p>

<p>"No. 5. Mr. C.'s speech, September
19."</p>

<p>"No. 6. Mr. C.'s letter, November 3."</p>

<p>"No. 7. Mr. C.'s speech, February
15."</p>

<p>"No. 8. Identity of commerce."</p>

<p>Besides this, Mr. Webster wrote out the
concluding part of the speech in twenty-one
pages of a rather small letter-paper,
of which I have the last eight, which
correspond to about three of the seventy-six
pages which the whole speech occupies
in the printed report. This part
seems to have been corrected again and
again. A fac-simile of a part of one of
these pages is here given, showing how
careful was Mr. Webster's revision and
correction. The whole page runs:</p>

<p>"Sir, the spirit of Union is particularly
liable to temptation, &amp; seduction, in moments
of peace &amp; prosperity. In war,
this spirit is strengthened, by a sense of
common danger, &amp; by a thousand recollections
of ancient efforts, &amp; ancient glory,
in a common cause.</p>

<p>"In the calms of a long peace, &amp; the absence
of all apparent causes of great alarm,
things near gain an ascendancy over things
remote. Local interests &amp; feelings overshadow
national sentiments. Our attention,
our regard, &amp; our attachment, are
ever more solicited to what touches us
closest, feel less and less the attraction
of a distant orb. Such tendencies, we
are bound by true patriotism, &amp; by our
love of union, to resist."</p>

<p>Mr. Calhoun replied to this speech of
Webster, March 22, 1838, in a speech reported
in his Works, vol. 3, pages 279-330.
Calhoun had both Webster and Clay on
his hands in this debate. He certainly
bore himself with great courage and ability.
The South had no reason to be ashamed
of her champion, so far as this was a struggle
of pure intellect. When Calhoun got
through, Webster instantly rose and answered
him in the speech beginning with
the famous passage about carrying the war
into Africa, reported in Webster's Works,
vol. 4, page 500, but not found in the
<i>Globe</i>. The <i>Globe</i> at that time was a
weekly paper, containing very imperfect
reports of the daily debates in the Senate.
An appendix was published at the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the session, which had some of the more
important speeches written out from the
reporters' notes or from other sources, probably
under the supervision of their authors.
This speech ended the discussion between
Calhoun and Webster on this particular
measure, although the debates on financial
and other questions for several preceding
and succeeding years make, in substance,
but one long debate between these two
famous champions, in which the whole
issue between North and South, slavery
and freedom, State rights and national
powers, was under discussion.</p>

</div>

<p>One passage in this speech explains the
following note here given in fac-simile,
from John Tyler to Mr. Webster, his Secretary
of State, written when Jackson broke
the silence of the Hermitage:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-085.jpg" width="327" height="208" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"The old Lion still roars.
See Genl. Jackson's letter
among those which
are sent.<br />
<span class="i4">J. T."</span></p>
</div>

<p>"On the broad surface of the country,
Sir, there is a spot called 'the Hermitage.'
In that residence is an occupant very well
known, and not a little remarkable both in
person and character. Suppose, Sir, the
occupant of the Hermitage were now to
open that door, enter the Senate, walk forward,
and look over the chamber to the
seats on the other side. Be not frightened,
gentlemen; it is but fancy's sketch. Suppose
he should thus come in among us,
Sir, and see into whose hands has fallen
the chief support of that administration,
which was, in so great a degree, appointed
by himself, and which he fondly relied on
to maintain the principles of his own. If
gentlemen were now to see his steady military
step, his erect posture, his compressed
lips, his firmly knitted brow, and his eye full
of fire, I cannot help thinking, Sir, they
would all feel somewhat queer. There
would be, I imagine, not a little awkward
moving and shifting in their seats. They
would expect soon to hear the roar of the
lion, even if they did not feel his paw."</p>

<p>This speech Mr. Everett declared to be
the ablest and most effective of Mr. Webster's
speeches on the currency. Lord
Overstone, than whom there was never a
higher authority upon finance in England,
produced a copy of it before a committee
of the House of Commons, by whom he
was examined, and said it was one of the
ablest and most satisfactory discussions of
these subjects he had ever seen. He afterward
spoke of Mr. Webster as a master
who had instructed
him upon these
matters.</p>

<p>There are notes
of a speech on the
currency which occupy
two pages and
three and one-half
lines of common
letter-paper. The
two sentences at
the close sum up
not only Webster's
final conclusion after
a life of reflection
upon the subject,
but, I believe,
the final conclusion
of the country as to
the great doctrine
of protection. "The sacrifice made by
reducing prices must necessarily fall on
labor."</p>

<p>"If price of cotton reduced, at home,
may be not abroad. So other articles.</p>

<p>"But labor is fixed down to the place.
If you reduce its price, it has no escape.
The whole result, then, of reducing cost
of production comes merely to this&mdash;that
the capitalist shall manufacture at a less
price, and deduct the loss in price from
the labor of his workmen. This is the
whole of it.</p>

<p>"I am for protecting labor. I am for
enabling it to clothe itself well, feed itself
well, and educate itself. I am desirous
of giving to labor here, in its competition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
with capital, advantages which it does
not possess elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Every man, who contemplates reduction,
must survey the condition of other
countries, with which we have great
intercourse."</p>

<p>Mr. Webster went to Washington to attend
the session of December, 1832, under
the burden of a great responsibility. He
had borne his share in the great debate
in which he established the authority of
the Union against the doctrine of
nullification in a manner which had won for
him the undying regard of the vast majority
of his countrymen. President Jackson
had done his part in asserting his
determination to uphold the Constitution
at all hazards and against all enemies.
In all that, the President and Mr. Webster
were in thorough accord. But he had no
sympathy with President Jackson's desire
to overthrow the banking system, to provide
simply instrumentalities for the government
to transact its business, leaving
the business of the country to look out for
itself. On the other hand, a considerable
portion of his own party, led by Mr. Clay,
desired to compromise with nullification,
and so to modify the tariff as to leave
South Carolina a substantial victory, and
save her pride from being compelled to
submission to the superior strength of the
government. With this element Mr. Webster
had no sympathy. Again, Jackson
claimed to be the direct representative of
the people, desired to extend the power
of the executive and to circumscribe the
legislative power, especially that of the
Senate. In resisting that encroachment
Webster and Calhoun were in complete
accord. So Mr. Webster could have no
permanent alliance or co-operation either
with Jackson, Calhoun, or Clay.</p>

<p class="caption">Fac-simile of the First Paragraph of Webster's "Principles."</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Webster prepared for himself the
following statement of the principles which
were to govern his own course in this great
emergency. Some of its language is found
in his speech in the Senate of February 8,
1833. But with that exception, it has
never, I believe, been made public until
now. It is the chart which governed his
course in that part of his public life of
far greatest public importance, and the
part of his public conduct on which his
own fame must rest:</p>

<p class="center p2">"PRINCIPLES.</p>

<p>"1. To sustain the administration, in executing
the laws; to support all measures,
necessary to supply defects in the existing
system; &amp; to counteract the proceedings
of South Carolina; to limit all their measures,
&amp; all this support, to the fair purpose
of executing the laws, with moderation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
&amp; temperance, but with inflexible
firmness;&mdash;to share this responsibility with
the Administration, frankly &amp; fairly, without
expressing any want of confidence, &amp;
without mingling other topics, with the
consideration of these measures.</p>

<p>"2. Not to give up, or compromise, the
<i>principle of protection</i>; nor to give any
pledges, personal or public, for its abandonment
at any time hereafter.</p>

<p>"3. To bring down the revenue to the
just wants of the Govt.: but this not to
extend so far as to prevent Congress from
making, for a limited time, a distribution
of the proceeds of the sales of the public
lands among the States, if Congress shall
see fit to make such distribution: nor so
far as to prevent appropriations to such
objects of Internal improvement, as Congress
may think deserving of national aid.</p>

<p>"4. To revise the Act of last session,
with close scrutiny, &amp; entire candor; &amp;
to reduce duties, in all cases, where such
reduction can, with any fairness, be asked,
&amp; with any safety, granted; having just
regard, to the necessities of the Country
in time of war, to the faith plighted by
existing &amp; previous laws to the reasonable
protection of capital, &amp; especially to the
security of the interests of <i>labor &amp; wages</i>.</p>

<p>"5. If Congress shall not, before the end
of the next session of Congress, pass a law
for the distribution of the proceeds of the
public lands, among the States, those proceeds
to be regarded as so much general
revenue, applicable to the ordinary purposes
of Government; &amp; the duties on
imports to be so much farther reduced as
may, by this means, become necessary.</p>

<p>"6. Provision to be made to direct the
framing of proper issues in law, feigned or
real, with a view to submit to the judgment
of the Supreme Court of the U. S.
the question, whether Congress possesses
the Constitution to lay &amp; collect duties on
articles imported, for the avowed and only
purpose of protecting &amp; encouraging domestic
products &amp; manufactures.</p>

<p>"7. If the land bill shall pass, then some
measure to be adopted to limit, practically,
grants by Congress to objects of Internal
Improvement, to such as in their nature
transcend the powers &amp; duties of separate
States.</p>

<p>"8. A Comee. of the Senate to sit in the
recess to take into consideration the law
of the last session (according to Art. 4),&mdash;to
make a detailed Report, the first day of
next session; accompanied by such a bill,
as they may recommend, for the purpose
of adjusting the Revenue to the necessities
of Government.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;My idea would be, that this
Comee. should meet in Boston, Oct. 1,
&amp; prosecute its inquiries, in Boston, Providence,
N. Y., Philadelphia &amp; Pittsburg,
if thought necessary.</p>

<p>"The Comee. to consist of one N. E.
member</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>one from Middle States,</p>
<p>one from N. W. States,</p>
<p>one from S. W. States,</p>
<p>one from Southern States."</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is very unpleasant to think that the
great sentences of the Reply to Hayne,
which the country knows by heart, were
never delivered by Mr. Webster in the
Senate chamber as we have them. Yet so
it is. The speech was taken down in short-hand
by Joseph Gales, one of the editors
of the <i>National Intelligencer</i>, and one of the
best stenographic reporters of that day.
He was requested by Mr. Webster beforehand
to report his speech, which he did.
He wrote out his short-hand report at
length. That report was submitted to Mr.
Webster, and he, with it in his possession,
wrote out in his own hand a revised version
of the speech. Mr. Everett says, in the
Life prefixed to his edition of Mr. Webster's
Works, that Mr. Webster had Gales's report
but a part of a day. But it is absolutely
impossible that Mr. Everett is correct,
although the statement was published
in Mr. Webster's lifetime. The short-hand
notes, and the speech as written out from
them by Gales, and the speech in Mr.
Webster's handwriting, are now all in the
possession of the Boston City Library.
They were purchased of Mrs. Gales, widow
of Joseph Gales, for the sum of $575
by Robert C. Winthrop, acting in behalf
of himself and twenty-two other subscribers
who gave $25 each for the purpose.
Mr. Webster wrote out the whole of it,
although about a third of his manuscript
is missing, not, however, the most important
or the best known portion. The
draught itself shows traces of revision and
reconsideration by Mr. Webster in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
matter of the structure of some important
sentences. He changes Gales's report a
great deal, and then in revision makes
corrections again and again of his own
draught. We give the famous passage
about Massachusetts, and the noble peroration,
as they are reported by the accurate
short-hand writer, doubtless literally as they
were spoken, and the passages as finally
composed by Mr. Webster and now familiar
to the world. The sentences actually
spoken well account for the great impression
made upon the auditors. They
are such as Webster would have been
likely to utter on a great occasion and
great theme. But we do not like to think
that any word or syllable among those
that have stirred our hearts from our
earliest boyhood did not, in fact, come
from the inspired lips of the great patriot
and orator. The emotion is like that felt
when a lover of Milton sees the manuscript
of Comus or Lycidas in the library
at Cambridge, and learns that any other
than the fit word and perfect phrase could
ever have occurred to the poet to express
his thought. The exquisite beauty of the
verse still abides. But the sense that it
was an inspiration is gone.</p>

<p>It is said that when Milo in his exile
read Cicero's speech in his defence, he
exclaimed, "O Cicero, hadst thou spoken
thus, Milo would not be now eating figs at
Marseilles." We cannot say that of the
Reply to Hayne. Its grandeur is there
as it came unpremeditated and fresh from
heart and brain. But it is a little unpleasant
to think that the phrases that all
Americans know by heart differ so much
from those which commanded the applause
of the listening Senate on that great
day which settled in the tribunal of reason
the fate of the Republic.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>The Passage about Massachusetts as
Actually Spoken</i></p>

<p>"Sir, I shall be led on this occasion
into no eulogium on Massachusetts. I
shall paint no portraiture of her merits,
original, ancient or modern. Yet, sir, I
cannot but remember that Boston <i>was</i>
the cradle of liberty, that in Massachusetts
(the parent of this accursed policy
so eternally narrow to the West), etc.,
etc., etc. I cannot forget that Lexington,
Concord and Bunker Hill <i>are</i> in
Massachusetts, and that in men and means and
money she <i>did</i> contribute more than any
other State to carry on the Revolutionary
war. There was not a State in the Union
whose soil was not wetted with Massachusetts
blood in the Revolutionary
war, and it is to be remembered that of
the army to which Cornwallis surrendered
at Yorktown a majority consisted of New
England troops. It is painful to me to
recur to these recollections even for the
purpose of self-defence, and even to that
end, sir, I will not extol the intelligence,
the character and the virtue of the people
of New England. I leave the theme to
itself, here and everywhere, now and forever."</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>As Written Out by Mr. Webster and
Printed</i></p>

<p>"Mr. President, I shall enter on no
encomium upon Massachusetts. She needs
none. There she is. Behold her, and
judge for yourselves. There is her history;
the world knows it by heart. The past, at
least, is secure. There is Boston, and Concord,
and Lexington, and Bunker Hill; and
there they will remain forever. The bones
of her sons, falling in the great struggle for
Independence, now lie mingled with the
soil of every State from New England to
Georgia; and there they will lie forever.
And Sir, where American Liberty raised
its first voice, and where its youth was
nurtured and sustained, there it still lives,
in the strength of its manhood and full of
its original spirit. If discord and disunion
shall wound it, if party strife and blind
ambition shall hawk at and tear it, if folly
and madness, if uneasiness under salutary
and necessary restraint, shall succeed in
separating it from that Union, by which
alone its existence is made sure, it will
stand, in the end, by the side of that cradle
in which its infancy was rocked; it will
stretch forth its arm with whatever of vigor
it may still retain over the friends who
gather round it; and it will fall at last, if
fall it must, amidst the proudest monuments
of its own glory, and on the very
spot of its origin."</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>Peroration as Actually Spoken</i></p>

<p>"When my eyes shall be turned for the
last time on the meridian sun, I hope I
may see him shining bright upon my united,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
free and happy country. I hope I shall
not live to see his beams falling upon the
dispersed fragments of the structure of this
once glorious Union. I hope I may not
see the flag of my country with its stars
separated or obliterated; torn by commotions,
smoking with the blood of civil war.
I hope I may not see the standard raised
of separate State rights, star against star,
and stripe against stripe; but that the flag
of the Union may keep its stars and its
stripes corded and bound together in indissoluble
ties. I hope I shall not see written
as its motto, '<i>First</i> liberty, and <i>then</i>
union.' I hope I shall see no such delusive
and deluded motto on the flag of that
country. I hope to see, spread all over it,
blazoned in letters of light and proudly
floating over land and sea, that other
sentiment, dear to my heart, 'Union <i>and</i>
Liberty, now and forever, one and inseparable.'"</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>Peroration as Written Out by Mr. Webster
and Printed</i></p>

<p>"When my eyes shall be turned to behold
for the last time the sun in heaven, may
I not see him shining on the broken and
dishonored fragments of a once glorious
Union; on States dissevered, discordant,
belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds,
or drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood!
Let their last feeble and lingering glance
rather behold the gorgeous ensign of the
republic, now known and honored throughout
the earth, still full high advanced, its
arms and trophies streaming in their original
lustre, not a stripe erased or polluted,
nor a single star obscured, bearing for its
motto, no such miserable interrogatory as
'What is all this worth?' nor those other
words of delusion and folly, 'Liberty first
and Union afterwards'; but everywhere,
spread all over in characters of living light,
blazing on all its ample folds, as they float
over the sea and over the land, and in
every wind under the whole heavens, that
other sentiment, dear to every true American
heart, Liberty <i>and</i> Union, now and
forever, one and inseparable!"</p>

<p>The family of one of Mr. Webster's colleagues
have a story which has been repeated
to me several times, but, so far as
I know, has never been published, that the
delegation were somewhat anxious lest
Mr. Webster did not fully appreciate the
strength of Hayne's attack, and the grave
responsibility he had to bear in the reply.
One of them at the request of his associates
called on Mr. Webster that morning
at his boarding-house, to communicate to
him their great anxiety. He found him
alone in the parlor of his dwelling, walking
up and down, and humming to himself the
refrain of the old English hunting-song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Tantivy, tantivy,</p>
<p>This day a stag must die.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>He concluded there was no occasion
for any further alarm.</p>

<p>When Mr. Webster went to the Senate
next morning, as he made his way through
the crowded chamber to his seat, John M.
Clayton, of Delaware, said to him: "Mr.
Webster, I hope you are primed and loaded
this morning." "Five fingers, sir,"
was the reply, with a gesture as if pointing
to a gun-barrel.</p>

<p>Mr. Winthrop says: "Of his emotions
he said himself not long afterward, 'I
felt as if every thing I had ever seen or
read or heard was floating before me in
one grand panorama, and I had little else
to do than to reach up and cull a thunderbolt
and hurl it at him.'"</p>

<p>What he said to Hiram Ketcham, of the
Reply to Hayne, is true of nearly all his
great speeches:</p>

<p>"In one sense I had no preparation
whatever, but in another sense I was fully
prepared. I did not know what words I
should use when I rose to my feet, nor the
order of argument in which I should proceed.
These came to me under the excitement
of debate. But I understood the
subject as well as I was capable of understanding
it. I had studied it; I had often
urged similar arguments before other tribunals,
and in this sense of the term I was
thoroughly prepared."</p>

<p>It is clear that there was absolutely no
time for the preparation of the language
of Webster's Reply to Hayne. He had
made an extemporaneous reply to Hayne&mdash;to
an elaborate speech of Hayne's&mdash;the
morning after it was delivered. Hayne replied
to him, and Webster, after a single
night's interval, made in two successive
days the most famous speech in American
history.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>We may sum up what we know of Mr.
Webster's habit of preparation and composition
as follows:</p>

<p>First. He spoke always upon great subjects.</p>

<p>Second. They were subjects upon
which he had long meditated with the
expectation that he would be called upon
to discuss them in public.</p>

<p>Third. He had matured in his mind
the arguments on great public questions,
and also eloquent thoughts and sentences
which had occurred to him during such
meditations, ready for use when such occasion
came.</p>

<p>Fourth. With these exceptions his
speeches were usually unpremeditated,
both as to language and order of arrangement,
except so far as he jotted down
some points or heads just before he spoke.</p>

<p>Fifth. In some few instances he wrote
out his speeches beforehand, making occasional
corrections and interlineations,
which in general did not seriously change
or improve his first expression.</p>

<p>Sixth. Many of the speeches we have,
especially those made in the Senate or
made to political assemblies, are as taken
down by the reporters, and not revised
by him.</p>

<p>Seventh. Some few, as for example,
the Plymouth Oration and the Reply to
Hayne, were carefully revised and largely
written out by him afterward.</p>

<p>Eighth. He was quite susceptible to
the stimulant of the audience or the
occasion, which not infrequently excited him
to the very loftiest and most effective
eloquence.</p>

<p>Ninth. In general, Webster's style was
not a Saxon style. It was of a somewhat
ponderous latinity. But on a few
occasions, when his mind rose to a white
heat, all the resources of our language,
whatever their origin, were at his command
in amplest measure.</p>

<p>Tenth. In general he mastered his subjects;
his subject did not master him. Solidity,
sincerity, gravity, self-restraint,
characterized his every thought and every
utterance. But sometimes the volcano
poured out its molten lava.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster made an impression upon
the people of Massachusetts, in his time,
as of a demi-god. His magnificent presence,
his stateliness of manner, his dignity,
from which he never bent, even in his
most convivial and playful moments, his
grandeur of speech and bearing, the habit
of dealing exclusively with the greatest
subjects, enabled him to maintain his
state. His great, sane intelligence pervades
every thing he said and did. But
he has left behind few evidences of
constructive statesmanship. There is hardly
a great measure of legislation with which
his name is connected, and he seems to
us now to have erred in judgment in a
great many cases, especially in undervaluing
the great territory on the Pacific. He
consented readily to the abandonment of
our claim to the territory between the
forty-ninth parallel and that of fifty-four
forty, which would have insured our supremacy
on the Pacific, and have saved
us from the menace and rivalry there of
the power of England. He voted against
the treaty by which we acquired California.
That, however, is a proof of a larger foresight
than that of any of his contemporaries.
Alone he foresaw the terrible Civil
War, to which everybody else of his time
was blind. What even he did not foresee
was the triumphant success of the Union
arms. It is hardly to be doubted that if
the Civil War had come in 1850 or 1851
instead of 1861 its result would have been
different. But Mr. Webster's great service
to the country, a service second to
that of Washington alone, is that he inspired
in the people to whom union and
self-government seemed but a doubtful
experiment, the sentiment of nationality,
of love of the flag, and a passionate
attachment to the whole country. When
his political life began, we were a feeble
folk, the bonds of the Union resting lightly
upon the States, the contingency of disunion
contemplated without much abhorrence
by many leading men, both
North and South. Mr. Webster awoke in
the bosom of his countrymen the conception
of national unity and national greatness.
It has been said more than once
that the guns of our artillery in the great
battles of the Civil War were shotted with
the Reply to Hayne.</p>

<p>A few years ago the State of New
Hampshire presented to the United States
for the Memorial Hall a statue of Webster&mdash;a
ceremonial in which I had some part.
After it was over, I got a letter from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
brave Union soldier, who told me he had
been stationed as a sentinel in a place in
the woods where several sentries had been
killed within a short time by a shot from
the thicket. As he paced up and down
on his midnight watch, thinking that at
any moment his death-shot might ring out
from the darkness and gloom about him,
he kept up his heart by repeating to himself,
over and over again, the great closing
sentences of the Reply to Hayne,
ending with the well-known words, "Liberty
and Union, now and forever, one and
inseparable."</p>

<p class="p2">History has not yet settled the question
of the motive that inspired the 7th of
March speech.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Doubtless there were
good and patriotic men, men who had
loved him till that hour, who went to their
graves believing that Webster fell&mdash;fell
like Lucifer, Son of the Morning. There
are doubtless men living who think so to-day.
To the thought of these men Whittier
gave voice in his terrible Ichabod,
which is said to have wounded the great
heart of its subject more than any other
stroke that ever smote his mighty forehead.
But the general judgment of his
countrymen, first mellowing and softening
into the belief which Whittier himself expressed
in his later and tender poem, "The
Lost Opportunity," seems gradually coming
to the conclusion that Webster differed
from the friends of freedom of his time,
not in a weaker moral sense, but only in a
larger and profounder prophetic vision.
When he resisted the acquisition of California,
he saw what no other man saw, the
certainty of the Civil War. It was not
given even to him to foresee its wonderful
and victorious result. When he compromised
he saw in like manner the danger
he tried to avert. He did not see the
safety only to be attained through the path
of danger and strife. I was one of those
who in the conceit and presumption of
youth, a lover of the liberty to which he
then seemed to me to be recreant, judged
him severely. But I have learned better
in my old age. I think of him now only
as the best type of the farmer's boy of the
early time; as the great example of the
New England character of the day of his
earlier manhood; as the great defender
and lover of Massachusetts, as the orator
who first taught his country her own greatness,
and who bound fast with indissoluble
strength the bands of union; as
the first of American lawyers, the first of
American orators, the first of American
statesmen, and as the delightful citizen
and neighbor and friend, of whom the people
of his town said when he was laid in
the grave:</p>

<p>"How lonesome the world seems;"
and of whom his nearest friend said, when
he died:</p>

<p>"From these conversations of friendship
no man&mdash;no man, old or young&mdash;went
away to remember one word of profanity,
one allusion of indelicacy, one impure
thought, one unbelieving suggestion,
one doubt cast on the reality of virtue, of
patriotism, of enthusiasm, of the progress
of man&mdash;one doubt cast on righteousness,
or temperance, or judgment to come."</p>

<h2>HAVANA SINCE THE OCCUPATION<br />
By James F. J. Archibald</h2>

</div>

<p>It is six months since the American administration
in Havana began, and in
that time many important changes
have been made and many more are well
under way; and the new ideas that are
eventually destined to supplant the customs
of the last century are fast taking a
firm hold on the country. Even for those
who have tried to follow
this progress in
detail in the newspapers
it is not easy
to realize the full extent
of what has been
accomplished, or of
the steady hard work
that is going on.
Very few bear in
mind the fact that a
comparatively large
section of our regular
army is engaged in it
here and elsewhere in
Cuba. Without the
blare of trumpets and
without the inspiring
strains of music the
same heroes that
came home fever-stricken,
wan, and
worn from that terrible struggle before
Santiago are again facing a more subtle
danger and fighting none the less
hard and all in the same cause, but now
there are no flaring headlines in our daily
press, no bulletins to tell of the fight,
because it is only against an unseen foe
and there is no noise&mdash;but the hard
work is there. Regiment after regiment
of the volunteers goes home, but these
men who "serve for pay" are sent down
to the island again before they have rid
themselves of the fever contracted while
standing knee-deep in water in the trenches
around Santiago. Now, it is hard work
all day long under a burning tropical sun
and many nights of weary patrol in the
pest-hole of all creation&mdash;plain hard work
to start a republic on the list of nations, to
teach a people how to govern themselves
who have before known nothing but the
lash. All honor is due to these men who
are doing this work; and our people are
too prone to forget it, simply because the
actual results are not immediately and always
in evidence.</p>

<p>I saw the Eighth United States Infantry,
just plain regulars from nowhere, before
El Caney, and again I saw them in
Havana patrolling the streets night and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
day, with two nights a week in bed. The
regiment had by no means recovered from
the Santiago campaign, and every day
some one would be taken with that bone-racking
fever that burns the life slowly
out unless checked by a transfer to a
Northern clime. But with it all there was
no complaining, and they were soldiers in
these times as well as in the field. Every
private seemed to have the success of the
commanding general at heart, and every
officer watched with pride the daily improvement
in the capital city.</p>

<p class="caption">The Lieutenant-Governor's Palace.</p>

<p>Two of the largest sewers of the city empty into the harbor at this point.</p>
</div>

<p>The staff shares the danger with the
line, and their work is the same steady,
uninteresting grind. The engineers face
death just as surely constructing sewers
as they do digging trenches during an
advance, the aides whether carrying despatches
to a brigade on the firing line
or reporting on some infested quarter in
the city, and the surgeons whether attending
the wounded at the front or Yellow
Jack in some charity hospital. There is
no glory for them if they succeed in this
fight against death and disease, and they
will get no thanks, for it is simply their
duty.</p>

<p>The work has been going steadily on
and is now well in hand, but it will be a
long time before we shall be able to turn
the island over to the Cuban people, and
we cannot withdraw our forces until every
detail of the new government has been
thoroughly tested. A
generation of education
seems to be the only solution
of the Cuban
problem that confronts
the American people,
that they may keep the
promise made to the civilized
world to establish
a stable form of government
for an excitable
little nation that does
not know its own mind,
and that is so divided
that internal strife is always
inevitable. Not
merely an education of
letters is needed, but an
education in cleanliness,
in religion, and in respect
for superior knowledge
of affairs; and it is
that education that the
American army officer
has been giving since the first day of January,
in the face of obstacles thrown in the
way by the very people who will eventually
reap the benefits of his labors. That the
American people should for any other object
than personal gain want to cleanse
their city, organize their government, and
teach them how to rule themselves, does
not seem possible to them, and it is on
account of this distrust that the work of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
establishing order is made difficult and at
many times disagreeable.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-095a.jpg" width="284" height="215" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A Street Corner.</p>
</div>

<p>During the sovereignty of Spain no
Cuban was ever consulted on any part of
the administration of the affairs of the island,
and for this reason they are largely
ignorant of all the requirements of organization,
unmindful of the necessity of proper
municipal sanitary arrangements, and
incompetent to cope with the suffering of
their own people.</p>

<p>When our forces first occupied Havana
the city was in a state of chaos, without
the restraint of law, and the officers and
men of the evacuating army had virtually
an officially recognized license to do their
will, no matter what it might dictate. Some
Spanish officials had destroyed nearly all
of the records of the island in
the archives of the public
buildings; and the result of
this work, apparently done
merely from spite, will be felt
for many years to come, especially
in the matter of the records
of real-estate transfers,
as at the present time it is
almost impossible to obtain
a clear title to any piece of
property. In some cases the
records were totally destroyed
or carried away, and in others
they were hopelessly disarranged
so as to render them
quite useless; the work showing
that it was done by someone
who understood the records
and knew just what papers
would be missed the
most. An instance of this
mischief may be given in the
Department of Engineers,
where they either destroyed
or carried away every map or
plan showing the location or
construction of the sewers of
the city; and by the loss of
those plans the American engineers
are compelled to hunt
out the different mains, and it
more than doubles their labor.
In the matter of the
real-estate records it will take
years to get them in a condition
that will be satisfactory
to the demands of
legal evidence in the transfer of property.</p>

<p>General Ludlow is doing excellent work
in the matter of bringing Havana out of
the unhealthful condition it was in when
he took command, and it is a work that
will take many months of hard labor and
in which, in all probability, many lives will
be sacrificed. He is greatly hampered in
his work by not being able to make his department
reports direct to Washington, as
the course through division military channels
is exceedingly slow.</p>

<div class="figright">

</div>

<p>The condition of Havana in December,
when the first of our Army of Occupation
arrived, was filthy beyond all possibility of
description. There being no sanitary arrangements
for the poor or in the abodes
of the poorer classes, the streets and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
court-yards of some of these houses were in
a disgusting condition. The most surprising
feature was the total lack of all modesty;
and these people really considered
it in the light of a great oppression, and
as a direct infringement upon their liberty
and upon their rights, that the Americans
should compel them to obey sanitary laws.
The people of all classes were in the habit
of throwing refuse of all sorts into the street,
and there was no attempt made to carry it
away, the rains being depended upon to
clean the streets. There were carcasses of
animals that had reached such a state of
decay that it was possible to detect the terrible
odor for many blocks, and yet the
presence of this nuisance did not seem to
annoy, in the slightest degree, those at
whose door it lay, while to an American it
was almost impossible to pass in the vicinity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Columbus Market, showing Street Cleaners in the Distance.</p>
</div>

<p>The lack of a proper sewerage system is
the cause of nearly all the disease and
pestilence that have made Havana one of
the most dreaded ports of the world. There
are more and better sewers than is generally
supposed, but the cause of their breeding
sickness is the fact that they are, in
many cases, open to the street by man-holes,
and they all empty into the harbor
immediately in front of the city. Two of
the main sewers flow into the channel of
the harbor directly under the Lieutenant-Governor's
Palace, in which General
Ludlow lives and in which he has his head-quarters;
one empties under the Maestranza
de Artilleria, in which some of the
troops were quartered; and from these
mains flow all the filth of Havana, that
pest-hole of disease, while at all times there
arises a sickening odor, and it will be the
greatest of wonders if there is not much
sickness among our troops, who are accustomed
to cleanliness at home. The
one thing that always is the most noticeable
to Americans on their arrival in any
of the towns or cities of Cuba is the offensive
odor that is ever present.</p>

<p>The public buildings were in such a condition
that not one of them could be used
until they had been thoroughly cleaned.
General Brooke made his head-quarters in
the Vedado, a charming suburb, on account
of the condition of the Captain-General's
Palace, which, although it was occupied
at the time of the evacuation by the Captain-General,
was in such a condition that
there were over thirty wagon-loads of filth
hauled out of it.</p>

<p>All of the prisons, except the Presidio of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Havana, were in a disgusting state of filth,
but the same hard work has turned them
into healthy buildings.</p>

</div>

<p>Under the direction of Lt-Colonel W. M.
Black, an officer of the
regular Engineer Corps,
the city has already become
clean, and the death-rate is decreasing every
month; and if the dreaded plague is averted this
summer it will be owing
to his labors, although he
would in no wise be at
fault were it to appear.
Colonel Black has had
most of the undesirable
work, for in his department is included all of the
street cleaning, sewers,
harbor dredging, and
cleaning all of the public
buildings. Havana must
remain in the same unhealthful
condition as long
as the main sewers empty
into the harbor, as this is
almost tideless and is little
better than a stagnant
pond; and although the
water at the surface does
not appear to be very foul,
its condition is seen when
a steamer moves along in the harbor and
her screw stirs up the bottom, which creates
the usual vile odor. It is the plan
of the new administration to turn all of the
sewers into the sea several miles from the city,
the natural grade making
the work comparatively
easy, and in this way the
greatest fault will be remedied&mdash;that
of pouring
the refuse into the harbor.
When the dredging of the
harbor commences in
earnest and the narrow
streets are dug up to lay
the sewers, then will probably
come a terrible sickness;
and as a great portion
of the labor must
come from the United
States we are surely destined
to pay still more
dearly for the freedom we
are establishing for the
Cuban people.</p>

<p>Surface street cleaning
has done more to make
Havana cleanly than anything
else, and it was but
a short time after the occupation
that the city began
to show the effects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
of this work. It was amusing to note the
astonishment of many of the inhabitants
when the first few squads of sweepers commenced
work; and the idea of cleaning
an unpaved street seemed to amuse them
more than to impress them, as the majority
did not know what it meant to sweep even
their houses. Large gangs of native labor
were given work in this department at
good wages, not only for the sake of the
work that was to be done, but also to allow
them to earn their support; and among
these street workmen were many gentlemen
of standing in society who embraced
the first opportunity to earn bread for
starving families. The residents of Havana
did not fare badly during the war,
but the planter from the interior, whose
estate had been burned and devastated,
whose stock had been killed, by both the
Cuban and the Spanish forces, and who
had been compelled to move into the city
by an edict from the Spanish, although
there had been no arrangement made for
his maintenance, suffered terribly.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Captain General's Palace and the Mayor's Office.</p>

<p class="caption">Camp of the Second United States Artillery in the foreground.</p>
</div>

<p>The employment of these large numbers
of men will also solve the problem
of ridding the island of the depreciated
Spanish currency, for all of this labor is
paid in American money, and already the
merchants are showing their preference
for it.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features
of the change in affairs in Cuba is the
Church, and the change that must be
made in the administration of the affairs
of that body. The Church being a part
and department of the state and entirely
dependent upon the government for its
support, suddenly finds itself compelled to
find other means of revenue. The Church
of Cuba is not one that Catholicism could
be proud of, except in the orders of women,
for nearly all of the men's orders
live in old monasteries a picturesque
but inactive life of comparative comfort.
Here are the same monks that one sees in
Spain, the brown garb of the Franciscan
with the sandalled feet, or the white and
black of the Dominicans. Captain E. St.
J. Greble, of General Ludlow's staff, has
had charge of the poor of the Havana
province and has worked night and day,
with his heart in the work, to relieve the
suffering; and he called at all of the
churches to see what they needed, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
none of them seemed in need, and yet
their people were dying of want. Not so,
however, with the women of the Church,
for they had worked faithfully to accomplish
what had been left undone. The
Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters of Charity, the
Order of the Sacred Heart, and several
others had their convents filled with women
and children of all ages and in all
conditions of want, caring for them and
many times denying themselves to feed
their charges. One sister told us that they
had not expected any help from us, as we
were considered a Protestant nation and
they dreaded our coming; and great tears
rolled down her cheeks as we unloaded
food and medicines for her charges.
These noble women assist our officers in
their work and are a marked contrast to
the monks. There seems to be a total lack
of any religious feeling; and on Sundays
very few ever enter the churches, but the
day is spent in pleasure and revel. Each
Sunday of the Carnival which takes place
during Lent, crowds of maskers throw
flour and <i>confetti</i> all day and spend the
night in dancing. Many pounds of flour
were thus thrown away every Sunday,
while thousands were suffering from hunger,
yet great indignation was raised
when the waste was prohibited, much
of the flour used being what had been issued
to Cuban Relief Committees for the
poor.</p>

</div>

<p>Organizing the police and the courts
for the city was one of the most difficult
tasks that were accomplished during the
reconstruction; and although it is well
started it will take many months to perfect
these departments. Major John Gary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Evans, U.S.V., a former Governor
of South Carolina, has had this
portion of the work under his
care and has organized a creditable
force from the material at
hand. Major Evans has been recently
mustered out of the service,
and Captain W. L. Pitcher, of
the Eighth Infantry, has been put
in charge of the work, and being
a thorough soldier and a man of
great diplomatic tact, he is just
the man for the position at this
critical period.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p>Always having been governed,
the Cubans here again showed
their lack of power to govern.
The officers seemed to think their
duties consisted of wearing a
smart uniform and sitting over
some liquid refreshment in a café;
and only as they realize the importance
of their office under
American teaching will they cease
to be dismal failures.</p>

<p class="caption">Beggars at a Church Entrance.</p>
</div>

<p>Cuban politics also enter into the difficulty.
When the Assembly deposed
Gomez from the head of the army, and
the parade and mass meeting in his honor
were called, General Ludlow gave orders
that they should be allowed to have
their celebration as long as they were
orderly; but in direct violation of this
order, Chief Menocal instructed the
police, who had only been patrolling a
few days, to stop the parades, and in
this way the rioting was caused. There
is a total disregard for keeping the rolls,
although they are told about it every
day. One of the police officers was
found dead in the grounds of the Summer
Palace, where Gomez and his followers
were living, having been shot
through the head and having been dead
several days; yet at police head-quarters
they had not noticed that he was
absent from duty, from the fact that no
roll was kept. It is this sort of thing
that it is well for the persons to know
who will very soon commence to demand
that we withdraw our forces and
allow the Cubans to govern themselves.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Harbor Boats.</p>
</div>

<p>Two of the most characteristic
and at the same time unpleasant features,
may be noted among those that
have disappeared during the new administration
of affairs. One is the
ever-present professional street-beggar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
who infested the streets, invaded the cafés,
and stood guard at every church-door;
the other is the horrible bone-pit in the
Cristobal Colon Cemetery. There are few
prettier places allotted to the resting of the
dead than this cemetery, on the outskirts
of the city.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-101b.jpg" width="300" height="271" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A Court-yard in the Tenement District.</p>
</div>

<p>The entrance to the enclosure is superb,
the chapel is impressive, and the monuments
are costly works of art, but away
off in a far corner of the unused part of
the cemetery was an enclosure about seventy-five
feet square and fifty feet deep,
with ghastly skulls and bones in all conditions
of preservation, and piles of burial
cases of all degrees from a costly casket
down to a cracker-box or an oil-can. This
is the inhuman manner of disposing of the
bodies buried in a plot upon which the
rental is not renewed every
three years. There is ample
room that is unused, so
it is not the lack of space
that causes the disturbing
of the rest of the dead; it
must be merely for gain for
the cemetery corporation.
In many cases the bodies
of the poor are never buried
at all, but at one side of the
cemetery is a building,
called the "Dead-house,"
in which arrangements are
made for burning the bodies
with lime until there is
nothing left but the bones,
which are then thrown into
this pit. Thousands upon
thousands were here in a
pile that was fully forty feet
deep and as large as the
area of the pit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>The residents of Havana
did not seem to know of the
presence of this place, and if
any did they seemed to take
it as a matter of course, and
no notice was taken of the
horrible custom; but when
the Americans took charge
it was the most talked-of
place in Havana, and became
one of the sights of
the city, creating such an
amount of adverse criticism
that the cemetery authorities
caused dirt to be thrown in
the pit to cover the bones.</p>

<p>Not only in Havana have
reforms been going on, but
all over the island the same
work is being done by the
American officers and men.
Under General Fitzhugh
Lee the province of Havana
has seen the same radical
changes, and all of the little towns have
been washed and fed and begin to live
anew.</p>

<p>The entire island is a great park that
needs no artificial training to enhance
its beauty, and it is destined to become
the winter resort of all the Eastern States.
But great administrative improvements in
the ports, besides the police
and material ones noted, will
be necessary before this can
happen. For instance, it
would do much for the island
if the port of Havana
could be freed from the high
pilot fees, anchorage fees,
docking fees, and fees of all
sorts that make it impossible
for small craft to enter.
Even the large steamers do
not dock, but cargo has to
be lightered out and passengers
are compelled to use
the small boats that swarm
the harbor.</p>

<p>The people have not even
begun to realize that the soldiers
are there to help them
in the establishment of their
republic; to them a soldier
means oppression, and the
presence of armed troops
gives them the idea that we are trying to
keep the territory that we have paid so dearly
to conquer. Not only must the Cubans
realize what our troops, both officers and
men, are doing, but our own people should
realize it in the same sense. It is easy to
criticise, but a nation cannot be built in a
day; and whether they are establishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
stable government in Cuba and Porto Rico
by diplomacy, or by the sword in the
Philippines, Americans should feel, concerning
these new duties, that those on the
spot often know best the needs of the situation;
that the regular army are American
soldiers, and that of what they are doing
the nation will be proud in years to come.</p>

<h2 class="p6">THE WHITE BLACKBIRD<br />
By Bliss Perry</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-103.jpg" width="72" height="73" alt="M" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Mid-afternoon in August;
a scarcely perceptible
haze over the line of
hills that marched northward
into the St. Lawrence
valley; and here, under the
fir balsams back of the great dingy Morraway
Hotel, coolness and quiet. Through
the lower boughs of the balsams gleamed
the lake, blue-black, unsounded, reticent.
Behind their slender cone-darkened tops
glistened the bare shoulders of Morraway
Mountain in full sunlight; and overhead
hung one of those caressing, taunting,
weather-breeding skies that mark the turning
point of the brief northern summer.</p>

<p>Curled up at one end of a broken rustic
seat under the shadow of the balsams
was a strenuous little woman of thirty-five,
conscientiously endeavoring to relax. The
habitual distress of her forehead was mitigated
by a negligent, young-girlish manner
of doing up her hair; she was carelessly
dressed, too, and as she read aloud to her
companion from <i>The Journal of American
Folklore</i> she kept swinging one foot over
the edge of the seat until the boot-lacings
were dangling. The printed label upon
the cover of the <i>Journal</i> bore the name of
Miss Jane Rodman, Ph.D.</p>

<p>Miss Rodman's niece was stretched on
the brown, fragrant, needle-covered slope,
pretending to listen. Her face was turned
dreamily toward the lake. Her head rested
upon her left hand, which was long,
sunburned, and bare of rings. In the
palm of her right hand she balanced from
time to time a little silver penknife, and
then with a flash of her wrist buried the
point in the balsam-needles, in a solitary
and aimless game of mumble-the-peg.
She was not particularly attracted by what
her learned aunt was reading to her about
the marriage rites of the Bannock Indians.
In fact she buried the knife with a trifle
more spirit than usual when the article
came to an end.</p>

<p>Miss Rodman pencilled some ethnological
notes upon the margin of the <i>Journal</i>.
"There's another valuable article here,
Olivia," she said, tentatively. "It's upon
Blackfeet superstitions. Don't you think
I'd better read that too?"</p>

<p>The younger woman nodded assent,
without looking up. She was gloriously
innocent of any scientific interest, and yet
grateful for her aunt's endeavor to entertain
her. Miss Rodman began eagerly,
and Olivia Lane silently shifted her position
and tried to play mumble-the-peg
with her left hand. Ten minutes passed.</p>

<p>"Then there's a footnote," Miss Rodman
was saying, mechanically. "Compare
the Basque legend about the white
blackbird whose singing restores sight to
the blind."</p>

<p>The girl looked up suddenly. "What
was that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The white blackbird whose singing
restores the sight to the blind," repeated
Miss Rodman, in a softer voice.</p>

<p>Olivia moved restlessly and then sat
up, with fingers clasped about her knees.
There was a red tinge upon her round
sun-browned cheek, where it had nestled
in the palm of her hand. "A&mdash;white&mdash;blackbird?"
she inquired, with the incredulous
inflection of a child.</p>

<p>The elder woman nodded&mdash;that kindly
pitying nod with which a science-trained
generation recognizes and, even in recognizing,
classifies, the old poetic superstitions
of the race. But her pity was
really for the tall, supple, low-voiced girl
at her feet: this brave, beautiful creature
who was slowly growing blind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>Olivia glanced at her, with great brown
eyes that betrayed no sign of the fatal
web that nature was steadily weaving in
their depths. There was a slight smile
upon her lips. Each of the women knew
what was in the other's mind.</p>

<p>Miss Rodman laid down the <i>Journal</i>.
"I shouldn't have read it, dear," she said,
at last. "I didn't know what was coming."</p>

<p>"But it is such a pretty fancy!" exclaimed
Olivia. "I shall be looking for
white blackbirds under every bush, Auntie."</p>

<p>She drew a long breath&mdash;too long, alas!
for a girl of twenty&mdash;and then with a sort
of unconscious feminine instinct patted
her heavy hair more closely into place and
began to brush the balsam-needles from
the folds of her walking-skirt.</p>

<p>Miss Rodman made no answer. There
seemed to be nothing to say. In this
matter of Olivia's eyes nature was playing
one of her countless petty tragedies;
science, the counter-player, stood helpless
on the stage, and Olivia herself was
outwardly one of the coolest of the few
spectators.</p>

<p>She had done all that could be done.
Dr. Sands, the rising specialist, an intimate
friend of the Lanes and the Rodmans, had
sent her to London to consult
Watson, and Watson's verdict was not
reassuring. Then he had sent her to Forget,
at Paris, and Forget had shaken his
head. Finally Dr. Sands had advised her
to come here to the Morraway region for
the air and the perfect quiet. Once a
month he dropped everything in New
York and came up himself to make an
examination and give his brief report. At
the end of June he had told Miss Rodman
that Olivia had perhaps one chance
in five of keeping her eyesight. A month
later he pronounced it one chance in fifty.
Dr. Sands stayed three days at the Morraway
Hotel that time, before giving his
opinion, and a more difficult professional
duty he had never had to perform. If
she were only some girl who walked into
his office and out again, like the hundreds
of others, it would have been different,
but to tell Olivia Lane seemed as brutal
as it would have been to strike her. And
on this August evening he had promised
to come again.</p>

<p>By and by Miss Rodman slipped down
from the rustic bench and seated herself
by her niece. The girl stroked her aunt's
shoulder lightly. Everything that could
be said had been said already, when the
horror of that great darkness had not
drawn quite so near.</p>

<p>And yet there was one question which
Olivia longed to ask, though she feared
the answer; trembling either way, as a
child that asks whether she may run to
snatch a glistening shell upon the beach
even while another wave is racing to engulf
it. Olivia's blindness was that black,
all-engulfing wave. And the treasure
which she might catch to her bosom, childlike,
ere the dark wave fell?</p>

<p>"Auntie," demanded Miss Lane, abruptly,
"have you told Mr. Allan about
my eyes?"</p>

<p>Miss Rodman hesitated a moment.
"Yes, dear," she replied; and she added,
with an aunt's prerogative, "Why?"</p>

<p>"I wished him to know," answered
Olivia, simply. "And I preferred not to
speak of it myself. I am glad you told
him."</p>

<p>Miss Rodman flushed a little. She was
about to speak, apparently, but her niece
interrupted her.</p>

<p>"He's coming to take us over to the
Pines before supper, if he finishes his map.
It seems to me that a government geologist
has a very easy time, Auntie. Or isn't
Mr. Allan a serious-minded geologist?"</p>

<p>Her tone was deliciously quizzical; she
was conscious of a secret happiness that
made her words come fast and sure.</p>

<p>"I should think the field work would always
be interesting," replied Miss Rodman,
with more literalness than was demanded by
the occasion. "The preparation of
the maps seems to me purely mechanical
drudgery. If the Survey had a respectable
appropriation, Dr. Allan would be
left free for other things. Some of his
work has been very brilliant."</p>

<p>The girl laughed. It always amused
her to hear Miss Rodman, Ph.D., give
Elbridge Allan his Munich title. It was
like that old story of the Roman augurs
bowing solemnly to each other with a
twinkle in the eye.</p>

<p><i>"Hoho! hahei! hoho!"</i> sang a big,
boyish voice from the direction of the
Morraway Hotel.</p>

<p><i>"Hoho! hahei! Hahei! hoho!"</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>Olivia turned and waved her hand toward
the voice. "He doesn't get the
intervals of that Sword-song exactly according
to Wagner," she commented.
"But what a Siegfried he would make for
size!"</p>

<p>He came striding down the woodland
path, shouting out the Sword-song and
waving his pipe; a superb, tan-faced fellow
of twenty-five, clean-built, clean-shaven,
clear-eyed. His heavy hob-nailed
field shoes were noiseless upon the moss.
The loose, gray golf suit&mdash;with coat unbuttoned&mdash;showed
every line of his athlete's
figure, as he kept time to the rhythm
of that splendid chant. When he neared
the ladies, he lifted his cap, and all the
sunlight that strayed through the balsam
branches seemed to fall upon his face.</p>

<p>Miss Rodman gazed at him admiringly.
"Isn't he magnificent!" she murmured.</p>

<p>Olivia did not hear her. "He knows!"
she kept saying to herself. "And yet he
is coming!"</p>

<p>"Hail!" cried Allan, waving cap and
pipe together. "O ye idle women!"</p>

<p>"But we've been reading," explained
Miss Rodman.</p>

<p>He picked up the <i>Journal of Folklore</i>
and flung it down again. "Worse yet!"
he insisted. "You ought to be tramping.
Come, let's go over to the Pines."</p>

<p>"Is the map finished?" asked Olivia.</p>

<p>"Done, and despatched to an ungrateful
government. I'm going to strike work
for two days, to celebrate; then we begin
triangulations on the north side of the
lake. Well, aren't you coming?"</p>

<p>He put out his hand and swung Miss
Rodman to her feet. Olivia had risen
without assistance and was looking around
for her hat. Allan handed it to her.</p>

<p>"I have some letters to write," said
Miss Rodman. "I believe I won't go."</p>

<p>The geologist's face expressed polite
regret. Olivia was busied with her hat-pins.</p>

<p>"But Miss Lane may go," continued
her aunt. "You might take Dr. Allan
over in the canoe, Olivia. That would
save time."</p>

<p>The girl nodded, outwardly demure, inwardly
dancing toward that bright, wave-thrown
shell. "Very well," she said, "if
Mr. Allan will trust himself again to the
Water-Witch."</p>

<p>"Either of us could swim ashore with
the Water-Witch in our teeth," laughed
the geologist. "Come ahead!"</p>

<p>They started down the steep, shadowy
path to the lake, the two tall, lithe figures
swaying away from each other, toward
each other, as they wound in and out
among the trees.</p>

<p>Miss Rodman felt a trifle uncomfortable.
She had not been altogether honest
when Olivia asked her if Mr. Allan
knew about her eyes. In fact she realized
that she had been rather dishonest. She
had indeed told the geologist&mdash;what he
might have guessed for himself&mdash;that
Miss Lane's eyes gave her serious trouble,
and that she had been forbidden to use
them. But she had not told him that
Olivia was going blind. It was obvious
that he liked the girl, and Miss Rodman
shrank from letting the tragic shadow of
Olivia's future darken these summer
months unnecessarily. She recognized instinctively
that the geologist's attitude
toward her ward might be altered if he
were conscious of the coming catastrophe.
She wanted&mdash;yes, she owned to herself
that she wanted&mdash;to have Elbridge Allan
so deeply in love with Olivia that even if
the worst came true he would but love her
the better for her blindness. But to tell
him prematurely might have spoiled everything.
So reasoned Miss Rodman, Ph.D.</p>

<p>Yet, as she stood watching the disappearing
pair, she was conscious of a certain
irritation. If only he had not come
singing through the woods at just the
moment when she was about to explain
to Olivia that she had not told him the
worst! For she felt sure, now, that she
would have explained, if they had not
been interrupted. Well, she would confess
to Olivia after supper! And Miss
Rodman gathered up the <i>Journal of Folklore</i>
and the other reviews, and sauntered
back to the hotel. Ethics, after all, had
been only her minor subject when she took
her doctor's degree; she felt strongest in
ethnology.</p>

<p>Meanwhile old Felix, at the boat-house,
sponged out the tiny birch canoe, and
scowled as Allan stepped carelessly into
the bow with his big hob-nailed shoes.
Miss Lane tucked up the cuffs of her shirt-waist
to keep them from the drip of the
paddle, and Allan pocketed her sleeve-buttons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
Then old Felix pushed them off.
He had rented boats there for thirty years,
ever since those first grand seasons of the
Morraway Hotel, when the Concord
coaches ran, and before the railroad had
gone up the other valley, and left the
Morraway region to a mild decay. Thirty
years; but he had never seen a girl whom
he fancied as much as Olivia Lane. He
had pushed so many couples off from the
old wharf in his time, and never a finer
pair than this, yet he liked Olivia better
alone. He did not know why he disliked
the geologist, except that Allan had broken
an oar in June and had forgotten to
pay for it.</p>

<p>The pair in the Water-Witch grew
rather silent, as the canoe crept over the
deep, mountain-shadowed water. Allan
smoked his pipe vigorously, his eyes upon
Miss Lane; she seemed wholly occupied
with her paddling. As they neared the
shore he warned her once or twice when
the canoe grazed the sharp edges of protruding
basalt; but each time she avoided
them with what appeared to him extraordinary
skill. In reality she could not see
them, and thought he understood.</p>

<p>She gave him her hand as she stepped
ashore, and was conscious that he retained
it a moment longer than mere courtesy
demanded. He kept close to her side as they
breasted the steep mountain-path. Whenever
they stopped to rest, each could hear
the other's breathing. Now and then, at a
rock-strewn rise, he placed his fingers beneath
her elbow, to steady her. He had
never done it before.</p>

<p>"He knows!" she kept saying to herself,
deep down below all words. "He
knows! And he wants me to feel that it
makes no difference!" It thrilled her like
great music. Let the dark wave break, if
it must; it could not rob her of the shining
treasure. She could yet be loved, like
other women. The darkness without
would not be so dreadful, if all those lamps
that Heaven meant to be lighted in a
woman's soul were glowing!</p>

<p>They reached the crest of the knoll,
where a dozen ragged white pines towered.
Beneath them curved the lake, growing
darker already as the western sky began to
blaze. Olivia seated herself against one of
the pines, and, removing her hat, leaned
back contentedly. It was so good to
breathe deep and free, to feel the breeze
at her temples, to have the man who loved
her reclining at her feet. All this could
yet be hers, whatever happened!</p>

<p>And all at once, upon one of the lower
branches of the pine, she was aware of a
white blackbird. The utter surprise sent
the color from her face; then it came flooding
back again. In a tumult of unreasoning
joy, of girlish superstition, she bent forward
and caught Allan by the shoulder,
pointing stealthily at the startled bird.</p>

<p>"The white blackbird!" she whispered,
rapturously.</p>

<p>He glanced upward indifferently,
wondering at Miss Lane's ecstatic face. He
did not know that she cared particularly
for birds.</p>

<p>"It's an albino," he remarked. "I've
seen him three or four times this summer.
They have one in the museum at St. Johnsbury."</p>

<p>"Hush!" exclaimed, Olivia, with a low,
intense utterance that almost awed him.
"It may sing!"</p>

<p>But the bird fluttered its cream-white
wings, and disappeared into the upper
branches of the pine.</p>

<p>"It's too late," said the geologist.
"Blackbirds don't sing after midsummer."</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't understand!" she cried,
half-starting from her seat and peering
upward into the dusky, breeze-swept canopy.
"The white blackbird is the Restorer of
Sight!"</p>

<p>He looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"There's a legend!" she exclaimed.
"Auntie and I learned it this very afternoon.
The singing of a white blackbird
restores sight to the blind!"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, carelessly, rapping the
ashes out of his pipe, "what of that?"
And he looked up in her face again, thinking
that her luminous brown eyes had
never been so lovely.</p>

<p>He saw them change and grow piteous,
even as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Didn't Auntie tell you?" she demanded.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>She grew white, and a moan escaped her
lips. The truth dawned, clear and pitiless.
Aunt Jane had failed to tell him plainly,
and Elbridge Allan&mdash;her lover, as she had
believed&mdash;was yet in ignorance of her fate.</p>

<p>But the girl had had a long training in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
courage, and she spoke instantly. "Mr.
Allan, I am in all probability going to be
absolutely blind. They said that in Paris
and London last summer, and they gave
me a year. Dr. Sands told me a month
ago that I had but one chance in fifty."</p>

<p>Her voice was quiet and even, but she
did not trust herself to look at Elbridge
Allan. She gazed out over the gloomy lake
toward the sun-tipped peak of Morraway
Mountain, and waited. She would know,
now. So many times had she waited, like
this, for a verdict from the doctors, but her
heart had never seemed to stop quite still
before. She heard him make a surprised
movement, but he did not speak.</p>

<p>"I knew Billy Sands in college," he
said awkwardly at last. "He was too
lazy then to walk across the yard when
the bell rang."</p>

<p>"He is an old friend of ours," she replied,
in swift loyalty. "No one could
have been more kind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped, realizing that he was embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Miss Lane," he broke out, "it's terrible!
I had no idea it was as serious as
that. I'm sorrier than I can say. Is Billy
Sands really the best man to go to? There
used to be a wonderful oculist in Munich.
By Jupiter, it's too bad! Do you know,
I think you're immensely brave. I&mdash;I
wish I might be of some service."</p>

<p>Slowly she turned her eyes from the
mountain-top, and looked straight into his
face. It was a handsome face, full of boyish
trouble, of genuine sympathy, of tenderness,
even. And that was all there was
there. His eyes fell. The stillness was
so great that she could hear overhead the
sleepy flutter and chirp of the white blackbird,
the Restorer of Sight. And she was
blind no longer: she comprehended, in
that one instant, that he did not love her.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry&mdash;&mdash;" he began again.</p>

<p>"I am sure of that, Mr. Allan," she interrupted.
"But it is really better not to
talk about it. It cannot be helped. And
Auntie and I seldom speak of it." She
wished to be loyal to her aunt, through all.</p>

<p>Allan nodded his head. He was thinking
that it was a little unfair in Miss Rodman
to let a young fellow go on&mdash;well,
yes, liking a girl&mdash;without telling him that
she was liable to be blind.</p>

<p>Olivia found herself trembling.    Oh, if
he would only go away! She could bear
it, if she were alone! If he only would not
lie there and look regretful and pathetic!</p>

<p>From far up the valley to the southward
floated the faint whistle of the evening express.
"Mr. Allan," said Olivia, suddenly,
"you <i>can</i> do me a great service. Dr.
Sands is coming on that train, and I
promised Auntie to have a carriage sent
for him. I forgot it. Would you mind
attending to it? You might take the footpath
down to Swayne's, and telephone,
and I'll bring over the canoe."</p>

<p>Allan rose, with a look of relief which
he could not quite disguise. "You're sure
you don't mind going back alone?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>With a long troubled look at the girl's
downcast face he turned away and hurried
down the slope toward Swayne's. His
own dream-castle was in ruins, too; for
a month past he had begun to picture
Olivia's tall charming figure in the castle
entrance. She had all that he could possibly
have desired in a woman: beauty,
grace, humor, wealth&mdash;and she had seemed
to like him&mdash;and now she was going blind!
It was too bad&mdash;too bad. He felt very
hard hit. He stopped to light his pipe,
and then strode on, discontentedly.</p>

<p>Olivia threw herself face downward upon
the soft, sun-warmed pine-needles, and lay
there sobbing. It was hard to give him
up; harder still to feel that he had never
loved her at all. She had simply been
mistaken. Childlike, she had fancied it
was the sea-shell that was singing, when
in reality the music was only the echo from
her own pulse-beats. Wave after wave
of maidenly shame throbbed to her cheeks
and throat. She had wanted to be loved,
before that pall was flung over her life, and
while she could still be to her lover as other
women were to theirs. But she had had
no right&mdash;no right!</p>

<p>Moment by moment her girlhood seemed
to slip away from her, like some bright
vision that flees at day-break. She felt
already the terrible helplessness of her
doom, the loneliness of a blind woman
who is growing old. High overhead the
solitary, mateless white blackbird smoothed
his creamy wings and settled himself to
rest among the soughing branches. Morraway
Mountain grew gray and distant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
The mist began to rise from the swarthy
lake. Between the trunks of the ancient
pines the sunset glowed more and more
faintly. The wind began to whisper
solemnly in the woods. And still the girl
lay prostrate between the roots of the great
pine, praying to be forgiven for her selfishness.</p>

<p class="p2">It was quite dusk when she arose. With
some difficulty she found the path and
hurried downward, stumbling often and
once falling. But her courage rose with
the very play of her muscles. She had to
grope with her hands to find the canoe, so
thickly hung the mist already above the
lake. There were lights moving at old
Felix's boat-house, but Olivia could not
see them. She seated herself in the
Water-Witch, took her bearing from the
vague masses of mountain shadow, and
began to paddle with long, firm strokes.
As the canoe shot into deep water, she
was conscious that something scraped its
frail side. In another moment the water
was pouring over her ankles and knees.
She stopped paddling to feel for the leak,
and instantly the canoe began to settle.</p>

<p>With a powerful effort the girl freed herself
from it as it sank, although she went
under once and lost her hold upon the
paddle. But she was a practised swimmer,
and though the water chilled her
through and through she struck out in
what she fancied was the right direction.
After a dozen strokes the shore seemed
farther away, and she swam back in
growing fear to the spot where she
thought the canoe had sunk, in the hope
of picking up the paddle. Round and
round she swam, with a slow side-stroke,
trying to find it, but it had drifted away.</p>

<p>She was getting bewildered in the mist,
and the huge shadows that loomed above
the lake seemed all alike. She called once
or twice, and then remembered that Felix
had probably gone home, and that no one
could possibly hear her at the hotel. She
turned on her back and floated awhile, to
collect herself, and then, keeping her eyes
on a certain shadowy outline in the fog,
she struck out again with desperate coolness.
Even if she were quite wrong, the
lake was only half a mile wide here, and
she had made a half mile so often.</p>

<p>If only her clothing did not pull her
down so terribly! She had to turn over
and float, in order to rest, and in so doing
she lost her wavering landmark. A cry of
terror escaped her, and with that the
water slapped over her face for the first
time. She shook it out of her nostrils and
began to swim in a circle, peering vainly
through the curtain of fog. The shadows
had all melted again into one vast shadow.
Her strength was going now; every
stroke was an agony. She called&mdash;not
knowing that she did so&mdash;all the life-passion
of youth vibrating in the clear voice;
then she turned on her back to float once
more, making a gallant, lonely, losing fight
of it to the very last....</p>

<p>She felt quite warm now, and all of a
sudden she ceased to have any fear.
This was the way God was taking to keep
her from growing blind; she had been as
brave as she could, but now that nightmare
of life-long helplessness was over.
It was not to be Blindness, after all.
Death, beautiful, silent-footed, soft-voiced
Death had outstripped Blindness, and was
enfolding her&mdash;murmuring to her&mdash;murmuring&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And as she closed her eyes contentedly,
old Felix, swearing tremulously, leaned
out of his boat and drew her in.</p>

<p class="p2">But it was the two men in the other
boat who carried Miss Lane up to the
Morraway Hotel. One of them was Elbridge
Allan, pale and disconcerted; the
other a dark, quick-eyed, square-lipped
man, who dismissed the geologist rather
abruptly, after Olivia had been taken to
Miss Rodman's room.</p>

<p>"But she's my friend, Dr. Sands," he
pleaded.</p>

<p>"And mine. And my patient besides,
Mr. Allan," pronounced Dr. Sands.</p>

<p>"Then, Doctor," said Allan, nervously,
"you must let me ask you a question.
Miss Lane told me three hours ago that
she was going blind. I was&mdash;I don't mind
saying&mdash;very much upset by it. Is it
true?"</p>

<p>"Miss Lane's eyes are in a very serious
condition," replied Dr. Sands, in his slightly
bored, professional voice, while he measured
the other man from head to foot.</p>

<p>"There is no chance?"</p>

<p>"I would not say that," was the brusque
answer. "There is always a chance. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
will of course pardon me for not discussing
my patient?"</p>

<p>There was a quiet finality about this
query which did not invite conversation,
and Allan turned irresolutely away.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of the next forenoon
before Dr. Sands allowed Olivia to
talk. She lay on the couch in her aunt's
room, a fire of maple logs roaring on the
hearth, a cold fine rain whistling against
the shaking windows. The turn of the
year had come. Miss Rodman had gone
off to get some sleep. The famous young
oculist was poking determinedly at the
fire and calling himself hard names. He
might have known that that handsome
geologist would make himself obnoxious
to Olivia Lane!</p>

<p>"Doctor," spoke Olivia.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Lane." He was at her side
in a moment.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said, "I saw a
white blackbird yesterday, just as clearly!
It restores sight by its singing, only it
was too late in the year for it to sing."
There was a gentle irony in her voice, like
the echo of her old bravery.</p>

<p>"Was it you who took me out of the
water?" she asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I wasn't lucky
enough. It was Felix."</p>

<p>"Last night," said Miss Lane, slowly,
"I didn't want to be taken out. The
water seemed just the place for me. But
this morning I feel very much stronger&mdash;Oh,
very strong indeed!" She lifted one
hand, to show how powerful she was, but
it fell back upon the rug that covered her.</p>

<p>The doctor nodded. He was wondering
about Elbridge Allan.</p>

<p>"I can bear anything," she went on.
"You see I have had to think it all
through. You are going to tell me that
there is no chance, are you not? There
was but one in fifty, you said." It was
not hope, but only a great patience, that
shone softly in her eyes.</p>

<p>"If you have held your own for the
last month, we'll call it one in forty-nine,"
he replied. "But you see I don't know
yet whether you have held your own. I
don't know anything to-day, Olivia,
except that I love you. I have loved you
ever since I sent you to London."</p>

<p>She moved her head wearily, as if she
could not comprehend.</p>

<p>"Of course it's very stupid in me to say
so this morning," he exclaimed, ruefully.
"But I have waited too long already."
He was still thinking of Elbridge Allan.</p>

<p>"But I am going blind!" she cried,
flinging out her hands.</p>

<p>"Very likely, dear," he replied. "Yet
that has nothing to do with this."</p>

<p>She gave him a long, long look, the
tears starting.</p>

<p>"It is <i>you</i> that I am in love with," he
said, slowly. "But of course we will keep
on making a good fight for the eyes."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;can't&mdash;think," cried Olivia. And
indeed she seemed to be back in the unsounded
water again, shrouded by shadowy
forms, surrendering herself helplessly to
a power mightier than her own. Only it
was not Death that was murmuring now;
it was Life, gallant, high-hearted, all-conquering
Life, whose most secret name is
Love. And as in that other supreme moment
it was awe that the girl felt rather
than fear. "Not&mdash;now&mdash;," she whispered.
"Not&mdash;yet. I&mdash;can't&mdash;think."</p>

<p>"Well, don't!" he exclaimed, eagerly,
"I don't wish you to think. If you stop
to think, you'll refuse me."</p>

<p>Olivia smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"I want you to go to sleep again," he
declared. In an instant he had drawn
down the shades and placed the screen
before the fire. "And when you wake
up," he continued, "I shall be right here,
Olivia;&mdash;and always&mdash;right&mdash;here.&mdash;I think
that's about what I want to
say," he added, with a curious husky little
laugh.</p>

<p>The room was too dark for him to see
the delicate color surge into Olivia's pale
face. But her eyelids closed slowly, obediently,
and he went softly out.

<h2>SEARCH-LIGHT LETTERS<br />
LETTER TO A YOUNG MAN WISHING TO BE AN AMERICAN<br />
By Robert Grant</h2>

<p class="center p2">I.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-111.jpg" width="82" height="82" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">I wrote this once as a
definition of Americanism:
"It seems to me
to be, first of all, a consciousness
of unfettered
individuality coupled
with a determination to
make the most of self." In short, a compound
of independence and energy. To
you, in the earnest temper of mind which
your letter of inquiry suggests, this definition
may seem a generality of not much
practical value; declarative of essential
truth, yet only vaguely helpful to the individual.
Yet I offer it as a starting-point
of doctrine, for to my thinking the people
of the United States who have impressed
themselves most notably on the world have
possessed these two traits, independence
and energy, in marked degree. And to
you, whatever your condition in life, if you
consider, it must be apparent that manly
self-respect and enterprising force are essential
to character and good citizenship,
and that the prominence accorded to
these qualities by those who have analyzed
the component parts of our nationality is
a distinction which should be perpetuated
and reinforced by succeeding generations.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the counsel seems to approximate
a glittering generality for the
reason that the opportunities for acting
upon it no longer sprout on every bush as
in the forties, fifties, sixties, and seventies
of the present century when we were a
budding nation and much of our territory
was still virgin soil. I write "seems to
approximate" advisedly, for the opportunities
are just as plenty, merely less obvious.
Yet here again I must make this
qualification&mdash;one which recalls doubtless
the favorite aphorism employed to meet
the plea that the legal profession is over-crowded&mdash;that
there is always an abundance
of room on the top benches. Indisputably
the day has passed when the ambitious
and enterprising American youth
could have fruit from the tree of material
fortune almost by stretching out his hand.
Now he has to climb far, and the process is
likely to be slow and discouraging. The
conditions peculiar to a sparse population
in a new country rich in resources have
almost ceased to exist, and, though a young
nation still, we are face to face with the
problems which concern a seething civilization
where almost every calling seems
full. Now and again some lucky seeker
for fortune still finds it in a brief twelve-month,
but for the mass of American
young men the opportunities for speedy,
dazzling prosperity have ceased to exist.
Those who win the prizes of life among
us nowadays owe their success, in all but
sporadic cases, to unusual talents, tireless
zeal and unremitting labor, almost as in
England, and France, and Germany. So
also, with the passing of the period when
enterprise and ambition were whetted by
the promise of sudden and vast rewards,
have disappeared many of the traits, both
external and psychological, which were
characteristic of our early nationality.
The buffalo is nearly extinct, and with him
is vanishing much of the bluff, graceless
assertiveness of demeanor which was once
deemed essential by most citizens to the
display of native independence. Our point
of view has changed, broadened, evolved
in so many ways that it were futile to do
more than indicate by a general description
what is so obvious. Partly by the
engrafting and adoption of foreign ideas
and customs, partly by the growth among
us of new conditions beyond the simple
ken of our forefathers, our national life has
become both complex and cosmopolitan.
If we, who were once prone to believe our
knowledge, our manners, and our customs
to be all-sufficient, have been borrowing
from others, so we in our turn have been
imitated by the older nations of Europe,
and the result is an approximation in sympathies
and a blurring of distinctions. Political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
differences and race superficialities of
expression seem a larger barrier than they
really are, for in its broader faiths and
vision the civilized world is becoming homogeneous.
The ocean cable and the
facilities for travel have palsied insular
prejudice and lifted the embargo on the
free interchange of ideas. The educated
American sees no resemblance to himself
in the caricatures of twenty-five years ago,
and rejoices in the consciousness that the
best men the world over are essentially
alike. This, perhaps, is only another way
of reasserting that human nature is always
human nature, but this old apothegm has
a clearer significance to-day than ever before.</p>

<p>Yet the opportunities for the display of
enterprise and independence remain none
the less distinct because we are becoming
a cosmopolitan community and the old
spectacular flavor has been kneaded out
of the national life. Much of our free soil
has been appropriated by an army of emigrants
from Europe, and in connection
with this fact the saying is rife that every
foreigner seems infused with a new dignity
from the moment that he becomes an
American. This may be bathos in individual
cases, yet it is the offspring of truth.
Still it remains equally true that we have
an enormous foreign population whose
ideas and standards are those which they
brought with them. Proud as these men
and women may be of their new nationality,
and eager as they may be to aid in
the promotion of good citizenship, their
very existence here in large numbers has
altered the conditions of the problem of
Americanism. The problem involved is no
longer that of the winning of a new land
by a free, spirited people under a republican
form of government, but the larger
equation of the evolution of the human
race. Americanism to-day stands in a
sense more accurate than before as the experiment
of government of the people, for
the people, and by the people, and for the
most complete amalgamation of the blood
of Christendom which the human race has
ever known. We have lately been celebrating
our centennial anniversaries. Already
the great figures of our early history
seem remote. The struggle with which we
are concerned is more intense and broader
than theirs: It is the progress of human
society. You, whom I am addressing, find
yourself a unit in a vast, heterogeneous
population and a complex civilization.
You live in the midst of the most modern
aspirations and appliances, and cheek by
jowl with the joy and sorrow, the comfort
and distress, the virtue and vice of a great
democracy. Your birthright of independence
and energy finds itself facing essentially
the same perplexities as those which
confront the inhabitants of other civilizations
where the tide of existence runs
strong and exuberant. If our nationality
is to be of value to the world, Americanism
must stand henceforth for a rectification
of old theories concerning, and an
application of fresh vitality to the entire
problem of human living.</p>

<p>Love of country should be a part of the
creed both of him who counsels and him
who listens, yet I deem it my duty, considering
the nature of our topic, to suggest
that there are not a few in the world, foreigners
chiefly, who would be disposed to
answer your inquiry how best to be an
American, by citing <i>Punch's</i> advice
to persons about to marry, "don't!" It does
credit to your love of country that you
have assumed a true American to be a consummation
devoutly to be emulated. Humility
on this subject has certainly never
been a national trait, and I cannot subscribe
to any such doubt myself. But yet
again let me indicate that across the water
the point is at least mooted whether the
seeker for perfect truth would not be
nearer success if incarnated under almost
any other civilized name. Let me hasten
to add that I believe this to be due to national
prejudice, envy, and lack of intelligent
discrimination, especially the latter,
in that the foreigner is mistaken as to the
identity of the true American. It behooves
you therefore to ascertain carefully who
the true American is, for even my defence
seems to hint at the suggestion that all
Americans are not equally admirable.
Forty years ago an intimation that all
Americans were not the moral and intellectual,
to say nothing of the physical, superiors
of any Englishman, Frenchman,
German or Italian alive would have subjected
a writer to beetling criticism; but,
as I have already intimated, we have
learned a thing or two since then. And it
is not a little thing to have discovered that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
though their hearts were right and their intentions
good, our forefathers were not so
abnormally virtuous and wise as to entitle
them or us to an exclusive and proscriptive
patent of superiority. We glory in them,
but while we revere them as the fosterers
and perpetuators of that fine, energetic,
high-minded, probing spirit which we call
the touch-stone of Americanism, we are
prepared, with some reluctance, yet frankly,
when cornered, to admit that they did
not possess a monopoly of righteousness
or knowledge.</p>

<p>I shall assume, then, that you, in common
with other citizens, have reached this
rationally patriotic point of view and are
willing to agree that we are not, as a nation,
above criticism. If you are still inclined
to regard us, the plain people of these
United States, as a mighty phalanx of Sir
Galahads in search of the Holy Grail, the
citation of a few facts may act aperiently
on your mind and wash away the cobwebs
of hallucination. For instance, to begin
from the political standpoint, our acquirement
of Texas and other territory once belonging to
Mexico suggests the predatory
methods of the Middle Ages rather than an
aspiring and sensitive national public temper.
The government of our large cities
has from time to time been so notoriously
corrupt as to indicate at least an easy-going,
shiftless, civic spirit in the average
free-born municipal voter. It is a matter
of common knowledge that in the legislative
bodies of all our States there is a certain
number of members whose action in
support of or against measures is controlled
by money bribes. From the point
of view of morals, statistics show that poverty
and crime, drunkenness and licentiousness
in our large cities are little less rife
than in the great capitals of Europe; and
you have merely to read the newspapers to
satisfy yourself that individuals from the
population of the small towns and of the
country districts from the eastern limit of
Maine to the southwestern coast of California
are capable of monstrous murders,
rank thefts, and a sensational variety of
ordinary human vices. It were easy to illustrate
further, but this should convince
you that the patriotic enthusiast who
would prove the people of the United
States to be a cohort of angels of light has
verily a task compared with which the
labors of Sisyphus and other victims of impossibility
fade into ease. Even our public
schools, that favorite emblem of our
omniscience, have been declared by authority
to merit interest, but by no means
grovelling admiration, on the part of the
effete peoples of Europe.</p>

<p>We will proceed then on the understanding
that, whatever its past, the present civilization
of the United States reveals the
every-day human being in his or her infinite
variety, and that the true American
must grasp this fact in order to fulfil his
destiny. If our nation is to be a lamp to
the civilized world, it will be because we
prove with time that poor human nature,
by virtue of the leaven called Americanism,
has reached a higher plane of intelligent
virtue and happiness than the world
has hitherto attained. Who then is the true
American? And what are the signs which
give us hope that the people of the United
States are capable of accomplishing this
result? What, too, are the signs which induce
our censors and critics to shake their
heads and refuse to acknowledge the probability
of it?</p>

<p class="center p2">II</p>

<p>I will begin with the inverse process
and indicate a list of those who are not
true Americans, and yet who are so familiar
types in our national community that
the burden of proof is on the patriot to
show that they are not essentially representative.</p>

<p>No. 1. <i>The Plutocratic Gentleman of Leisure
who Amuses Himself.</i>&mdash;Here we have a
deliberate imitation of a well-known figure
of the older civilizations. The grandfather
by superior ability, industry, and enterprise
has accumulated a vast fortune. His
grand-children, nurtured with care, spend
their golden youth in mere extravagant
amusement and often in dissipation. There
are many individuals in our so-called leisure
class who devote their lives to intelligent
and useful occupation, but there is
every reason for asserting that the point of
view of the child of fortune in this country
is significantly that of the idler&mdash;and a
more deplorable idler than he of the aristocracies
of Europe whom he models himself
on, for the reason that the foreigner is
less indifferent than he to intellectual interests.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Is there any body of people in the
world more contemptible, and anybody
among us more useless as an inspiring product
of Americanism, than the pleasure-seeking,
unpatriotic element of the very
rich who, under the caption of our best society,
arrogate social distinction by reason
of their vulgar ostentation of wealth, their
extravagant methods of entertainment
and their aimless pleasure-loving lives?
To vie with each other in lavish outlay, to
visit Europe with frequency, to possess
steam-yachts, to bribe custom-house officers,
to sneer at our institutions and, save
by an occasional check, to ignore all the
duties of citizenship, is an off-handed epitome
of their existence. And in it all they
are merely copy-cats&mdash;servile followers of
the aristocratic creed, but without the genuine
prestige of the old-time nobilities. And
in the same breath let me not forget the
women.</p>

<p>(<i>Note.</i>&mdash;"I was afraid you were going
to," said my wife, Josephine. "Women
count for so much here, and yet their heads
seem to become hopelessly turned as soon
as they are multi-millionnaires.")</p>

<p>Women indeed count for much here,
and yet it is they even more than the men
who are responsible for and encourage the
mere pleasure-loving life among the leisure
class. A ceaseless round of every variety
of money-consuming, vapid amusement
occupies their days and nights from
January to January, and for what purpose?
To marry their daughters to foreign
noblemen? To breed scandal by
pursuing intimacies with other men than
their husbands? To demonstrate that the
American woman, when she has all the opportunities
which health, wealth, and leisure
can bestow, is content to become a
mere quick-witted, shallow voluptuary?</p>

<p>You will be told that these people are
very inconsiderable in number, that they
really exercise a small influence, and that
one is not to judge the men and women of
the United States by them. It is true that
they are not very numerous, though their
number seems to be increasing, and I am
fain to believe that they are not merely out
of sympathy with, but alien in character to,
the American people as a whole; and yet
I cannot see why an unfriendly critic
should not claim that they are representative,
for they are the lineal descendants of
the men from every part of the land who
have been the most successful in the accumulation
of wealth. Their grandfathers
were the pioneers whose brains and sinews
were stronger than their fellows in the
struggle of nation-building; their fathers
were the keenest and not presumptively
the most dishonest men of affairs in the
country. Not only this; but though the
plain people of the nation affect to reprobate
this class as un-American and evil, yet
the newspapers, who aim to be the exponents
of the opinions of the general
mass and to cater to their preferences,
are constantly setting forth the doings of
the so-called multi-millionnaires and their
associates with a journalistic gusto and
redundancy which reveals an absorbing
interest and satisfaction in their concerns
on the part of the everyday public.</p>

<p>Undeniably there are no laws which
prohibit the wealthy from squandering their
riches in futile extravagance and wasting
their time in empty frivolities, nor is our
leisure class peculiar in this when compared
with the corresponding class in other
countries, unless it be in a more manifest
bent toward civic imbecility. But, from
the point of view of human progress, is it
not rather discouraging that the most
financially prosperous should aspire merely
to mimic and outdo the follies of courts,
the heartless levity and extravagance of
which have been among the instigators
of popular revolution? Surely, if this is
the best Americanism, if this is what democracy
proffers as the flower of its crown
of success, it were more satisfactory to the
sensitive citizen to owe allegiance to some
country where the pretensions to omniscient
soul superiority were more commensurate
with the results produced.</p>

<p>No. 2. <i>The Easy-going Hypocrite.</i>&mdash;Here
is another slip from the tree of human
nature, which flourishes on this soil with
a sturdy growth. A large section of the
American people has been talking for buncombe,
not merely since years ago the
member of Congress from North Carolina
naïvely admitted that his remarks were
uttered solely for the edification of the
town of that name, and so supplied a descriptive
phrase for the habit, but from the
outset of our national responsibilities. To
talk for effect with the thinly concealed
purpose of deceiving a part of the American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
people all of the time has been and
continues to be a favorite practice with
many of the politicians of the country.
Yet this public trick of proclaiming sentiments
and opinions with the tongue in the
cheek is the conspicuous surface-symptom
of a larger vice which is fitly described as
hypocrisy. There is a way of looking at
this accusation which deprives it of part of
its sting, yet leaves us in a predicament not
very complimentary to our boasted sense
of humor. It is that the free-born American
citizen means so well that he is habitually
dazzled by his own predilections toward
righteousness into utterances which
he as a frail mortal cannot hope to live up
to, and consequently that he is prone to
express himself in terms which none but
the unsophisticated are expected to believe.
In other words, that he is an unconscious
hypocrite. However harmless
this idiosyncrasy may have been as a preliminary
trick of expression, there is no
room for doubt that the plea of unconsciousness
must cease to satisfy the most
indulgent moral philosopher after a very
short time. Yet we have persevered in the
practice astonishingly, until it may be said
that hyperbole is the favorite form of public
utterance on almost any subject among
a large class of individuals, in the expectation
that only a certain percentage will not
understand that the speaker or writer is
not strictly in earnest. In this manner the
virtuous and the patriotic are enabled to
give free vent to their emotions and to set
their fellow-citizens and themselves highest
among the people of the earth without
other expenditure than words, resolutions,
or empty laws. The process gently titillates
the self-esteem of the performer so
that he almost persuades himself for the
time being that he believes what he is
saying: He appreciates that his hearers
like better to have their hopes rehearsed as
realities at the expense of veracity than to
be reminded of imperfections at the expense
of pride: And he rejoices in those
whom he has fooled into believing that
their hopes have been realized, and that all
the virtue which he tremendously stands
for is part and parcel of the national equipment.
Under the insidious influence of
this mode of enlightenment the everyday
keen American citizen goes about with his
head in the air, knowing in his secret heart
that one-half of what he hears from the lips
of those who represent him in public is buncombe,
but content with the shadow for
the substance, and wearing a chip on his
shoulder as a warning to those who would
assert that we are not really as virtuous and
as noble as our spokesmen have declared.</p>

<p>For instance, to return to the concrete,
consider the plight of a police commissioner
in most of our large cities. Those
interested in the suppression of vice appear
before the legislature and urge the maintenance
of a vigorous policy. Acts are
passed by the law-makers manifesting the
intention of the community to wage vigorous
war against the social evil and the
sale of liquor, and prescribing unequivocal
regulations. The appointing power is
urged to select a strong man to enforce
these laws. Supposing he does, what follows?
Murmurs and contemptuous abuse.
Murmurs from what is known as the hard-headed,
common-sense portion of the community,
who complain that the strong man
entrusted with authority does not show
tact; that what was expected of him was
judicious surface enforcement of the law
sufficient to beguile reformers and cranks,
and give a semblance of improvement, not
strict, literal compliance. They will tell
you that the social evil can no more be
suppressed than water can be prevented
from running down hill, and that the explicit
language of the statutes was framed
for the benefit of clergymen, and that no
one else with common sense supposed it
would be enforced to the letter by any intelligent
official. The very legislators who
voted to pass the laws will shrug their
shoulders rancorously and confide to you
the same thing; yet in another breath assert
to their constituents that they have
fought the fight in defence of white-robed
chastity and the sacred sanctity of the
home.</p>

<p>Now, is this Americanism, the very best
Americanism? Surely not. It has an
Anglo-Saxon flavor about it which it is
easy to recognize as foreign and imported.
Englishmen have been asserting for centuries
that they were fighting the fight in
defence of white-robed chastity and the
sanctity of the home, to the amusement of
the rest of the world, for in spite of the
fact that the laws demand a vigorous policy
and the British matron and the Sunday-school
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Unions declare that the home
is safe, those familiar with facts know that
London is one of the most disgustingly impure
cities in the world, and that the youth
let loose upon its streets is in very much
the same predicament as Daniel in the den
of lions, without the same certainty of rescue.
And why? Because the hard-headed,
common-sense British public sanctions
hypocrisy. They tell you that they are
doing their utmost to crush the evil. This
is for the marines, the British matron,
and the Sunday-school Unions. But let a
strong man attempt to banish from the
streets the shoals of women of loose character,
and what an unmistakable murmur
would arise. How long would he remain
in office?</p>

<p>It may be that the social evil can no
more be suppressed than water can be
prevented from running down hill. That
is neither here nor there for the purposes
of this illustration. But to demand the
passage of laws, and then to abuse and
undermine the influence of those who try
to enforce them is a vice more subversive
to national character than the fault of
Mary Magdalene and her unpenitent successors,
both male and female.</p>

<p>Take, again, our custom-house regulations
concerning persons returning home
from abroad. The law demands a certain
tariff, yet it is notorious that a large number
of so-called respectable people are able
to procure free entry for their effects by
bribes to the subordinates. And why?
Because those who passed the law devised
it to cajole a certain portion of the community;
but those charged with the enforcement
of it, in deference to its unpopularity,
are expected to make matters
at the port smooth for travellers with easy-going
consciences. Hence the continued
existence at the New York Custom-house
of the shameless bribe-taker in all his disgusting
variety. Authority from time to
time puts on a semblance of integrity and
discipline, but the home-comer continues
to gloat over the old story of double
deceit, his own and another's. Is this the
best Americanism? Yet these are American
citizens who offer the bribe, who pocket
it, and who allow the abuse to exist by
solemnly or good-naturedly ignoring it.
Consider the diversity of our divorce laws.
It is indeed true that opinions differ as to
what are and what are not suitable grounds
for divorce, so that uniformity of legislation
in the different States is difficult of
attainment; yet there is reason to believe
that progress toward this would be swifter
were it not for the convenience of the
present system which allows men and women
who profess orthodoxy a loop-hole of
escape to a less rigorous jurisdiction when
the occasion arises. Similarly, in the case
of corporation laws, it is noticeable that
not far removed from those communities
where paid-up capital stock and other assurances
of good faith are required from
incorporators, some State is to be found
where none of these restrictions exist. Thus
an appearance of virtue is preserved, self-consciousness
of virtue flattered, a certain
number deluded, and yet all the conveniences
and privileges of a hard-headed,
easy-going civilization are kept within
reaching distance.</p>

<p>No. 3. <i>The Worshipper of False Gods.</i>&mdash;It
is a commonplace of foreign criticism
that the free-born American is insatiate for
money, and that everything else pales into
insignificance before the diameter of the
mighty dollar. That is the favorite taunt
of those who do not admire our institutions
and behavior, and the favorite note
of warning of those who would fain think
well of us. No one can deny that the influence
and power of money in this country
during the last thirty years have been
enormous. One reason for this is obvious.
The magnificent resources of a huge territory
have been developed during that
period. Men have grown rich in a night,
and huge fortunes have been accumulated
with a rapidity adapted not merely to dazzle
and stir to envy other nations, but to
turn the heads of our own people. We have
become one of the wealthiest civilizations,
and our multi-millionnaires are among the
money magnates of the world. Yet popular
sentiment in public utterance affects
to despise money, and inclines to abuse
those who possess it. I write "affects,"
for here again the point of hypocrisy recurs
to mind, and even you very likely
would be prompt to remind me that, according
to our vernacular, to make one's
pile and make it quickly is a wide-spread
touch-stone of ambition. True enough it
is that there has been, and is, room for reproach
in the aggressiveness of this tendency,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
and yet the seeming hypocrisy is
once more unconscious in that the popular
point of view intends to be sincere, but the
situation has been too dazzling for sober
brains and high resolves. For let it be
said that keenness of vision and a capacity
for escaping from the trammels of
conventional and inveterate delusions are
essentially American traits, and as a consequence
no one more clearly than the
American citizen appreciates the importance
of material resources as a factor of
happy living, and none so definitely as he
refuses to be discouraged by the priestly
creed that only a few can be comfortable
and happy in this life and that the poor
and miserable will be recompensed hereafter
for their earthly travails. His doctrine
is that he desires, if possible, to be
one of that comfortable and happy few,
and in the exuberance of his consciousness
that human life is absorbing, he fortifies
the capacity to make the most of it by
the quaint, convincing statement that we
shall be a long time dead. His quick-witted,
intelligent repugnance to the old
theory that the mass should be cajoled
into dispensing with earthly comforts has
helped to give a humorous, material twist to
his words; and yet, I venture to assert, has
left his finer instincts unperverted, except
in the case of the individual. This combination
of an extraordinary opportunity
and a shrewd intelligence has, however,
it must be admitted, produced a considerable
and sorry crop of these individuals
guided by the principle that wealth
is the highest good, and should be sought
at the expense of every scruple. Their
many successes in the accomplishment of
this single purpose have served to create
the impression that the whole nation is
thus diseased, and have done the greater
harm of dwarfing many an aspiring nature,
spell-bound by the cloud-capped towers
and gorgeous palaces which sheer money-making
has established. As a result the
best Americanism is menaced both by the
example of accumulation without conscience,
and the dangerous public atmosphere
which this generates, in that the common
eye is caught by the brilliance of the
spectacle, and the common mind lured to
meditate imitation at every sacrifice. So
they say of us that the American hero is the
man of material successes, "the smart man"
who "gets there" by hook or crook, and
that we are content to ask no embarrassing
questions as to ways and means, provided
the pecuniary evidences of attainment
are indisputable. The patriotic
American resents this as a libel, and maintains
that this type of hero-worship is but
a surface indication of the public soul, just
as the horrors of the divorce court are but
a surface indication of the general conditions
of married life. Yet the patriot must
admit that there is danger to the noble
aspirations which we claim to cherish as
Americans from the bright, keen, easy-going,
metallic, practical, hard-headed, humorous
citizen, male and female, whose
aim is simply to push ahead, at any cost,
and who in the process does not hesitate
to part with his spiritual properties as
being cumbersome, unremunerative and
somewhat ridiculous. The materialist
is no new figure in human civilization.
"Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow
we die," is but the ancient synonyme for
"we shall be a long time dead." A deep,
abiding faith in the serious purposes of humanity
has ever been obvious to us Americans
as a national possession, however
foreigners may deny it to us, but the American
nature is at the same time, as I have
suggested, essentially practical, level-headed,
and inquiring, and is ever ready with a
shrewd jest to dispute the sway of traditions
founded on cant or out-worn ideas.
It behooves you then, if you would be a
true American, to beware overstepping the
limit which separates aspiring, intelligent,
winsome common-sense from the philosophy
of mere materialism. There lies one
of the great perils of democracy; and
unless the development of democracy
be toward higher spiritual experiences,
Americanism must prove a failure. Keen
enjoyment of living is a noble thing, so too
is the ambition to overcome material circumstances,
and to command the fruits of
the earth. A realization of the possibility
of this, and an emancipation from dogmas
which foreordained him to despair,
has evolved the alert, independent, progressive
American citizen, and side by side
with him the individual whom the less enlightened
portion of the community have
enshrined in their hearts under the caption
of a smart man. This popular hero,
with his taking guise of easy-going good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
nature, assuring his admirers by way of
flippant disposition of the claims of conscience
and aspiration that "it will be all
the same a hundred years hence" is the
kind of American whom every patriot
should seek to discredit and avoid imitating.</p>

<p class="center p2">III</p>

<p>The foregoing suggestions will suffice,
I think, to demonstrate to you that we
are not uniformly a nation of Sir Galahads,
and that certain types of Americanism, if
encouraged and perpetuated, are likely to
impair the value and force of our civilization.
But having dispelled the hallucination
that we are uniformly irreproachable,
I would remind you that, in order to be
a good American, it is even more necessary
for you to appreciate the fine traits of
your countrymen than to be keenly alive
to their shortcomings. There are two ways
of looking at any community, as there are
two ways of looking at life. The same landscape
may appear to the same gaze brilliant,
inspiring, and interesting, or flat,
homely, and unsuggestive, according as
the eye of the onlooker be healthy or jaundiced.
It is easy to fix one's attention
on the vulgar and heartless ostentation of
the rich, on the cheapness and venality of
some of our legislators, on the evidences
of hypocrisy and false hero-worship, materialism,
and superficiality of a portion of
our population, and in doing so to forget
and overlook the efficacy and finer manifestations
of the people whose lives are
the force and bulwark of the state. It is
easy to go through the streets of a large
city and note only the noise and smoke
and stir, coarse circumstance and coarser
crime, neglecting to remember that beneath
this kernel of hard, real life the human
heart is beating high and warm with
the hopes and desires of the spirit. It is
not necessary for a human being, it is essentially
not necessary for an American,
to look at life from the point of view of
what the eye beholds in the hours of soul-torpor.
True is it that Americanism stands
to-day as almost synonymous with the
struggle of democracy, and that the equal
development of the life of the whole
people for the common good is what
most deeply concerns us; but this does
not mean that it is right or American to
adhere to what is ordinary and low, because
it is still inevitable that the ideals
and standards of the mass should not be
those of the finest spirits. It was an
American who bade you hitch your wagon
to a star, and you have only to reflect in
order to recall the spiritual vigor, the
righteous force of will, the strength of aspiring
mind, the patriotic courage, the
tireless soul-struggle of the early generations
of choicely educated, simply nurtured
Americans. Their thought and conscience,
true and star-seeking even in its
limitations, laid the foundations of law and
order, of civic liberty and private welfare,
of national honor and domestic repute.
Their enterprise and perseverance, their
grit and suppleness of intelligence wrested
our broad Western acreage from the savage and&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">(<i>Note.</i>&mdash;I was here interrupted in the
fervor of this genuine peroration by my
wife Josephine's exclamation, "Oh, how
atrociously they abused and persecuted
those poor Indians, shunting them off
from reservation to reservation, cheating
them out of their lands and furs!"</p>

<p>It is not agreeable to be held up in this
highwayman fashion when one is warming
to a subject, but there is a melancholy
truth in Josephine's statement which cannot
be utterly contradicted. Still this is
what I said to her: "My dear, I had
hoped you understood that I had referred
sufficiently to our national delinquencies,
and that I was trying to depict to my correspondent
the other side of the case.
However just and appropriate your criticism
might be under other circumstances,
I can only regard it now as misplaced and
unfortunate." I spoke with appropriate
dignity. "Hoity, toity, toity me!" she
responded. "I won't say another word.")</p>

<p class="p2">&mdash;wrested our broad Western acreage from
the savage, and in less than half a century
transformed it into a thriving, bustling,
forceful civilization. Their ingenuity, their
restless spirit of inquiry, their practical skill,
their impatience of delay and love of swift
decisive action have built countless monuments
in huge new cities in the twinkling of
an eye, in the marvellous useful inventions
which have revolutionized the methods of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the world, the cotton-gin, the steamboat,
the telegraph, the telephone, the palace-car&mdash;in
the eager response made to the call
of patriotism when danger threatened the
existence of their country, and in the
strong, original, clear-thinking, shrewdly
acting, quaint personalities which have
sprung from time to time from the very
soil, as it were, in full mental panoply like
the warriors of the Cadmean seed. Their
stern sense of responsibility, their earnest
desire for self-improvement, their ambitious
zeal to acquire and to diffuse knowledge
have founded, fostered, and supported
the system of public schools and well-organized
colleges which exist to-day in
almost every portion of the country. The
possessors of these qualities were Americans&mdash;the
best Americans. Their plan of
life was neither cheap nor shallow, but
steadfast, aspiring, strong, and patient.
From small beginnings, by industry and
fortitude, they fought their way to success,
and produced the powerful and vital nation
whose career the world is watching
with an interest born of the knowledge
that it is humanity's latest and most important
experiment. The development of
the democratic principle is at the root of
Americanism, but whoever, out of deference
to what may be called practical considerations,
abates one jot the fervor of his
or her desire to escape from the commonplace,
or who, in other words, forsakes his
ideals and is content with a lower aim and
a lower outlook, in order to suit the average
temper, is false to his birthright and
to the best Americanism.</p>

<p>It has been one of the grievances of
those whose material surroundings have
been more favorable and who have possessed
more ostensible social refinement
than the mass of the population, that they
were regarded askance and excluded from
public service and influence. There used
to be some foundation for this charge, but
the counter plea of the complainants of
lack of sympathy and distrust of country
was still more true, and an explanation and,
in a large measure, a justification of the prejudice.
True strength and refinement of
character has always in the end commanded
the respect and admiration of our people,
but they have been roughly suspicious
of any class isolation or assumption of superiority.
It has been difficult accordingly
for that type of Americans who arrogated
tacitly, but nevertheless plainly, the prerogatives
of social importance, to take an
active part in the responsibilities of citizenship.
They have been mistrusted, and
sneered at, and not always unjustly, for
they have been prone to belittle our national
institutions and to make sport of the
social idiosyncrasies of their unconventional
countrymen for the entertainment of
foreigners. And yet the people have never
failed to recognize and to reverence the
fine emanations of the spirit as evidenced
by our poets, historians, thinkers, or statesmen.
Our forceful humanitarian and ethical
movements, our most earnest reforms
found their most zealous and untiring supporters
among the rank and file of the people.
Abraham Lincoln was understood
last of all by the social aristocracy of the
nation. Emerson's inspiration found an
answering chord in every country town in
New England. True it is that on the surface
the popular judgment may often seem
superficial and cheap in tone, but the wise
American is chary of accepting surface
ebullitions as the real index of the public
judgment. He understands that mixed in
with the unthinking and the degenerate
is a rank and file majority of sober, self-respecting
men and women, whose instincts
are both earnest and original, and who are
to be depended on in every serious emergency
to think and act on the side of civilizing
progress. It is the inability to appreciate
this which breeds our civic censors,
who are led by their lack of perspective to
underestimate the character of the people
and to foretell the ultimate failure of our
experiment.</p>

<p>The increase of wealth and a wider familiarity
with luxury and comfort through
the country has made a considerable and
more important class of those whose material
and social surroundings are exceptional.
The participation of the citizens
of this class in the affairs of government is
no longer discouraged&mdash;on the contrary,
it is welcomed by the community. Indeed,
many men have secured nomination and
election to office solely because of their
large means, which enabled them to control
men and caucuses in their own favor.</p>

<p>(<i>Note.</i>&mdash;An appearance of spontaneity
is preserved in these cases by the publication
of a letter from leading citizens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
requesting the candidate to stand for office.
He thereupon yields to the overwhelming
invitation of the voters of the
district, and his henchmen do the rest.)</p>

<p>But though the possession of wealth and
social sophistication are no longer regarded
as un-American, the public sentiment
against open or tacit assumption of social
superiority, or a lack of sympathy with
democratic principles, is as strong as ever.
It is incumbent, therefore, on you, if you
would be an American in the best sense,
to fix your ideal of life high, and at the
same time to fix it in sympathy with the
underlying American principle of a broad
and progressive common humanity, free
from caste or discriminating social conventions.
It is not necessary for you to accept
the standards and adopt the behavior
of the superficial and imperfectly educated,
but it is indispensable that you accept
and act on the faith that your fellow-man
is your brother, and that the attainment
of a freer and more equal enjoyment of
the privileges of life is essential to true
human progress. We have, as I have intimated,
passed through the pioneer stage
of national development; we have tilled
our fields, opened our mines, built our railroads,
established our large cities&mdash;in short,
have laid the foundations of a new and
masterful civilization; it now remains for
us to show whether we are capable of treating
with originality the old problems which
confront complex societies, and of solving
them for the welfare of the public and the
consequent elevation of individual character.</p>

<p>The originality and clearness of the
American point of view has always been
a salient national characteristic. Hitherto
its favorite scope has been commercial and
utilitarian. Yankee notions have been suggestive
of sewing-machines, reapers, and
labor-saving contrivances, or the mechanism
of rushing trade. Now that we have
caught up with the rest of the world in
material progress and taught it many tricks,
it remains for the true American to demonstrate
equal sagacity and clear-headedness
in dealing with subtler conditions. To
be sure the scope of our originality has not
been entirely directed to things material,
for we have ever asserted with some vehemence
our devotion to the things of the spirit,
squinting longingly at them even when
obliged to deplore only a passing acquaintance
with them because of lack of time.
The splendid superficiality of the army of
youth of both sexes in the department of
intellectual and artistic exertion, which has
been one of the notable features of the
last thirty years, has shown clearly enough
the true temper and fibre of our people.
To regard this superficiality as more than a
transient symptom, and thereby to lose sight
of the genuine intensity of nature which
has animated it, would indicate the shallow
observer. Our youth has been audacious,
self-confident, and lacking in thoroughness
because of its zeal to assert and
distinguish itself, and thus has justly, in
one sense, incurred the accusation of being
superficial, but it has incurred this partially
because of its disposition to maintain
the privileges of individual judgments.</p>

<p>Our young men and women have been
blamed for their lack of reverence and
their readiness to form conclusions without
adequate knowledge or study in the teeth
of venerable opinion and convention. Indisputably
they have erred in this respect,
but indisputably also the fault is now recognized,
and is being cured in the curriculum
of education. Yet, evil as the fault is,
the traits which seem to have nourished it&mdash;unwillingness
to accept tradition and a
searching, honest clearness of vision&mdash;are
virtues of the first water, and typical of the
best national character. There are many
persons of education and refinement in our
society who accept as satisfactory and indisputable
the old forms and symbols which
illustrate the experience, and have become
the final word of the older civilizations in
ethics, politics, and art. They would be
willing that we should become a mere complement
to the most highly civilized nations
of Europe, and they welcome every
evidence that we are becoming so. As I
have already suggested to you, the nations
of the world are all nearer akin in thought
and impulse than formerly, but if our civilization
is to stand for anything, it must
be by our divergence from the conclusions
of the past when they fail to pass the test
of honest scrutiny, not by tame imitation.
Profoundly necessary as it is that we should
accept with reverence the truths of experience,
and much as our students and citizens
may learn from the wisdom and performance
of older peoples, it behooves the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
American to prize and cherish his birthright
of independent judgment and freedom
from servile adherence to convention.
Almost everything that has been truly vital
in our production has borne the stamp of
this birthright.</p>

<p>The American citizen of the finest type
is essentially a man or woman of simple
character, and the effect of our institutions
and mode of thought, when rightly appreciated,
is to produce simplicity. The
American is free from the glamour or prejudice
which results from the conscious or
unconscious influence of the lay figures
of the old political, social, or religious
world, from the glamour of royalty and
vested caste, of an established or dominant
church, of aristocratic, monkish, or military
privilege. He is neither impelled nor
allured to subject the liberty of conscience
or opinion to the conventions appurtenant
to these former forces of society. For him
the law of the state, in the making of which
he has a voice, and the authority of his
own judgment are the only arbiters of his
conduct. He accords neither to fineness
of race nor force of intellect the right of
aristocratic exclusiveness which they have
too often hitherto claimed. To the cloistered
nun he devotes no special reverence;
he sees in the haughty and condescending
fine gentleman an object for the exercise
of his humor, not of servility; he is indifferent
to the claim of all who by reason
of self-congratulation or ancient custom
arrogate to themselves special privileges
on earth, or special privileges in heaven.
This temper of mind, when unalloyed by
shallow conceit, begets a quiet self-respect
and simple honesty of judgment, eminently
serviceable in the struggle to live wisely.</p>

<p>To the best citizens of every nation the
most interesting and vital of all questions
is what we are here for, what men and
women are seeking to accomplish, what is
to be the future of human development.
For Americans of the best type, those who
have learned to be reverent without losing
their independence and without sacrifice
of originality, the problem of living is
simplified through the elimination of the
influence of these symbols and conventions.
Their outlook is not confused or
deluded by the specious dogmas of caste.
They perceive that the attainment of the
welfare and happiness of the inhabitants of
earth is the purpose of human struggle, and
that the free choice and will of the majority
as to what is best for humanity as a
whole is to be the determining force of the
future. To those who argue that the majority
must always be wrong, and that as a
corollary the will of the cheap man will prevail,
this drift of society is depressing. The
good American in the first place, recognizing
the inevitability of this drift, declines to
be depressed; and in the second, without
subscribing to the doctrine that the majority
must be wrong, exercises the privilege
of his own independent judgment, subject
only to the statute law and his conscience.</p>

<p>There is a noble strength of position in
this; there is a danger, too, in that it
suggests a lack of definiteness of standard.
Yet this want of precision is preferable to
the tyranny of hard and fast prescription.
It is clear, for instance, that if the men
and women of civilization are determined
to modify their divorce laws so as to allow
the annulment of marriage when either
party is weary of the compact, no canon
or anathema of the church will restrain
them. Nor, on the other hand, will the
mere whim or volition of an easy-going
majority force them to do so. The judgment
of men and women untrammelled by
precedent and tradition and seeking simply
to ascertain what is best and wisest for
all will settle the question. Though the
majority will be the force that puts any
law into effect, the impulse must inevitably
come from the higher wisdom of the few,
and that higher wisdom in America works
in the interest of a broad humanity, free
from the delusions of outworn culture.
The wisdom of the few may not seem to
guide, but in the end the mass listens to
true counsel. Honesty toward self and
toward one's fellow-man, without fear or
favor, is the leavening force of the finest
Americanism, and, if persevered in, will
lead the many, sooner or later, with a compelling
power far beyond that of thrones
and hierarchies. The wise application of
this doctrine of the search for the common
good in the highest terms of earthly condition
to the whole range of economic, social,
and political questions is what demands
to-day the interest and attention of earnest
Americans. The problems relating to capital
and labor, to the restraint of the money
power, to the government of our cities, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the education of all classes, to the status
of divorce, to the treatment of paupers
and criminals, to the wise control of the
sale of liquor, to equitable taxation, and
to a variety of kindred matters are ripe
for the scrutiny of independent, sagacious
thought and action. To the consideration of
these subjects the best national
intelligence is beginning to turn with
a fresh vigor and efficiency, but none too
soon. Though democracy and Americanism
have become largely identical, the
spread of the creed of a broader humanity
in the countries of civilization where autocratic
forms of government still obtain,
has been so signal and productive of results
that the American may well ask himself
or herself if our people have not been
slovenly and vain-glorious along the paths
where it seemed to be their prerogative to
lead. Certainly in the matter of many of
the civic and humanitarian problems which
I have cited, we may fitly borrow from
the recent and modern methods of those
to whom we are apt to refer, in terms of
condescending pity, as the effete dynasties
of Europe. They have in some instances
been more prompt than we to recognize the
trend of ours and the world's new faith.</p>

<p class="center p2">IV</p>

<p>In this same connection I suggest to
you that in the domain of literary art an
Englishman&mdash;a colonist, it is true, and so
a little nearer allied to us in democratic
sentiment&mdash;has more clearly and forcibly
than anyone else expressed the spirit of the
best Americanism&mdash;of the best world-temper
of to-day. I refer to Rudyard Kipling.
Human society has been fascinated
by the virility and uncompromising force
of his writings, but it has found an equal
fascination in the deep, simple, sham-detesting
sympathy with common humanity
which permeates them. He has been the
first to adopt and exalt the idea of the
brotherhood of man without either condescension
or depressing materialistic realism.
He has interpreted the poetry of
"the trivial round and common task" without
suggesting impending soup, blankets,
and coals on earth and reward in heaven
on the one hand, or without emphasizing
the dirtiness of the workman's blouse on
the other. His imagery, his symbols and
his point of view are essentially alien to
those of social convention and caste. Yet
his heroes of the engine-room, the telegraph-station,
the Newfoundland Banks,
and the dreary ends of the earth, democratic
though they are to the core, appeal
to the imagination by their stimulating human
qualities no less than the bearers of
titles and the aristocratic monopolists of
culture and aspiration who have been the
leading figures in the poetry and fiction of
the past. Strength, courage, truth, simplicity
and loving-kindness are still their
salient qualities&mdash;the qualities of noble
manhood&mdash;he expounds them to us by the
force of his sympathy, which clothes them
with no impossible virtues, yet shows them,
in the white light of performance, men no
less entitled to our admiration than the
Knights of King Arthur or any of the
other superhuman figures of traditional
æsthetic culture. He recognizes the artistic
value of the workaday life in law courts
and hospitals and libraries and mines and
factories and camps and lighthouses and
ocean steamers and railroad trains, as a
stimulus to and rectifier of poetic imagination,
negativing the theory that men and
women are to seek inspiration solely from
what is dainty, exclusive, elegantly romantic,
or rhapsodically star-gazing in human
conditions and thought. This is of the
essence of the American idea, which has
been, however, slow to subdue imagination,
which is the very electric current of
art, to its use by reason chiefly of the
seeming discord between it and common
life, and partly from the reluctance of the
world to renounce its diet of highly colored
court, heaven and fairy-land imagery;
partly, too, because so many of the best
poets and writers of America have adopted
traditional symbols. The school of great
New England writers which has just passed
away were, however, the exponents of the
simple life, of high religious and intellectual
thought amid common circumstance.
They stood for noble ideals as the privilege
of all. Yet their mental attitude,
though scornful of pomp and materialism,
was almost aristocratic; at least it was exclusive
in that it was not wholly human,
savoring rather of the ascetic star-gazer
than the full-blooded appreciator of the
boon of life. Their passion was pure as
snow, but it was thin. Yet the central tenet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
of their philosophy, independent naturalness
of soul, is the necessary complement
to the broad human sympathy which is of
the essence of modern art. The difficulty
which imagination finds in expressing itself
in the new terms is natural enough, for the
poet and painter and musician are seemingly
deprived of color, the color which we
associate with mystic elegance and aristocratic
prestige. Yet only seemingly. Externals
may have lost the dignity and lustre
of prerogative; but the essentials for color
remain&mdash;the human soul in all its fervor&mdash;the
striving world in all its joy and suffering.
There is no fear that the tide of existence
will be less intense or that the mind
of man will degenerate in æsthetic appreciation,
but it must be on new lines which
only a master imbued with the value and
the pathos of the highest life in the common
life as a source for heroism can fitly
indicate. There lies the future field for
the poet, the novelist, and the painter&mdash;the
idealization of the real world as it is in its
highest terms of love and passion, struggle,
joy, and sorrow, free from the condescension
of superior castes and the mystification
of the star-reaching introspective
culture which seeks only personal exaltation,
and excludes sympathy with the every-day
beings and things of earth from its so-called

By Fanny V. de G. Stevenson</h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Anne was walking down
the slope of a hill at the
time of the first stirring of
dawn on a spring morning.
She was an old woman,
now, her youth lying years
behind her; but she had not been one to
fall easily into the sere and yellow leaf.
Though frail in health, she had kept her
manifold interests sharp and lively; pictures
gave her pleasure keen as of yore,
and there was no critic of literature more
quick than she to detect a lapse in taste
or art, nor with a readier appreciation of
style, originality, or even intention. She
was, at last, however, forced to believe
that she was growing old. She <i>was</i> old,
and the days were flying past her with an
incredible rapidity. She rebelled with passionate
fierceness against the inevitable,
approaching end. As bitterly as for herself
(she was sixty and past), she resented
the fact that John, her husband, stood
even nearer the final catastrophe than she;
John, whom, though ten years her senior,
she had petted and spoiled like a child.
Hers had always been the dominant
mind. John, older and aging more rapidly
than she, had now become absolutely
dependent on her, almost for his thoughts.
Their marriage was blessed with no children,
wherefore all the motherly instincts
of the wife had been lavished on the husband.
"My very love has made him helpless,"
thought Anne; "pray God he be
called before me."</p>

<p>She walked more quickly, in time with
her thoughts, which now wandered along
devious pathways through the past. The
scenes she recalled were nothing in themselves,
no more than most elderly people
keep stored in their memories; but to her,
who had played the principal parts, they
were of the liveliest interest. The day she
and John took possession of the house
that had been their own ever since was as
vivid as yesterday. Nay, more vivid, for
she was not at all sure concerning yesterday;
she had had a headache, and was
stupid, and had slept a good deal; and
John dozed in his chair; there was nothing
to remember in yesterday.</p>

<p>But that first day in the new house,
both so proud, so fond, so full of plans;
and it was all over. The plans matured
or failed, and they were only two old
people, conscious of ever-failing strength,
careful of draughts, easily tired&mdash;well, no,
not so very easily tired after all, at least
not Anne, or at least not to-day. It must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
be the early morning, or the spring
weather. She had heard of old people
who recovered their faculties in a sort of
Indian summer, possibly her Indian summer
was about to burst into a mature blossoming.
She felt so light on her feet, so
uplifted as with a wholesome, altogether
delightful intoxication. The sensation
carried her far back to her childhood, to
a first day in the garden after a winter's
illness. How she skipped, and ran, and
laughed. She was conscious to-day of the
same pure joy in living. It was like being
a child again. And those sad, querulous
days, yesterday, and the days and years
before&mdash;that was the child's illness; such
a long illness, ever-increasing, with but
one terrible cure.</p>

<p>But not even that fancy could depress
Anne to-day, glorious to-day, this day of
ten thousand! She laughed aloud, pretending,
as children pretend, that she had,
unknowing, drunk of the golden elixir;
her eyes should be unclouded, her cheeks
flower-fresh, her scant, white locks changed
to rings of softest brown; a tall, slim slip
of a girl, as John first met her. At the
foot of the meadow where she kept tryst
with John there used to be a still pool
where she preened her feathers while
waiting for her gallant. She looked about
for a pool, smiling at this vanity in an old
woman; but suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;?</p>

<p>Of course she was always properly
dressed and coifed as became one of her
station and fortune, with a certain well-bred
deference to the prevailing modes,
and she owned to a nice taste in lace and
jewels. Jane, her maid, had been very
much remiss when she laid out the gown
her mistress wore this morning. It must
be a new one, by the way, or an old one
remodelled; it was not in her usual style,
but of a singular cut, stiff, plain, and ungraceful
in its prim folds. However, it
was white, and white was still Anne's
color. And what matters a gown when
one is in so high a humor?</p>

<p>The valley below was everywhere covered
with a white rime which ran in
sparkles as the sun touched it. It should
be sharply cold, Anne thought, but she
felt no chill. Frost generally passed over
the high ground, while it nipped the lower.
She hoped it had spared the tender plants
in her garden, and the budding peaches.
Already the crocuses were in bloom, and
the lilacs showed a few timid, scented
leaves. Anne was very fond of her garden,
and it was one of her grievances
against time that she could no longer tend
it in person.</p>

<p>She had forgotten why she searched for
the pool; she was a little confused, doubtless
the effect of yesterday's headache&mdash;nothing
unpleasant, rather a delightful,
dizzy jumbling of thoughts, ideas, remembrances.
At any rate, here was the pool,
clear and unruffled; new grass was springing
on its banks, and here and there
woolly brown bosses showed where ferns
were sprouting. She would fetch John
here one day&mdash;if he were able to walk so
far. John used to like a pool when his
sight was stronger; not in Anne's way;
her liking was innocent and sentimental.
John would bring his microscope and discover
the most wonderful things in water
that appeared absolutely pure. Decidedly
she must manage to fetch John.</p>

<p>Anne leaned over and looked into the
pool. She leaned farther, lower, turned
her head this way and that, and then drew
back in utter bewilderment. There was
no reflection of her face in the water!
She was overwhelmed with disappointment.
This enchanting rejuvenation, then,
was only a dream. She could almost have
wept; not quite, for the dream still held
her as in an embrace of joyousness. She
wondered what her body looked like, lying
on its bed while its soul was roaming the
fields. She pitied it, the worn, frail, old
body, as though it were a thing separate
from herself. It had suffered in its fairly
long life, and had endured many contrarieties,
but there had been more than compensating
happinesses, and no great sorrows.
She hoped it slept well. John's
dear, white head would be lying on the
pillow beside it. "Oh," she thought, "I
wish I could give my dream to John.
Well, it shall be the best dream in the
world if John is only to have it at second
hand."</p>

<p>In the certainty that she was dreaming,
Anne now gave her imagination a free
rein. False shame is out of place in a
dream. She gambolled like a prisoned
kid set free, and sang&mdash;softly, lest the
dream should be shattered. As the day
advanced wild things came out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
wood; squirrels, and other animals so shy
by nature that she had only seen them,
heretofore, at a distance, stopped beside
her and conversed together in their own
language. She saw what no naturalist has
ever beheld, God's creatures at home and
unafraid. She laid her hand on the head
of a doe as it drank at a pool, and ran
with it feather-footed. She spurned the
earth and took long, smooth flights over
the undergrowth like a bird sailing on the
wing.</p>

<p>Suddenly she became aware of a voice,
clear and penetrating, that spoke the
name&mdash;<i>Anne</i>. A face was before her,
vaguely familiar, a face of her childhood.</p>

<p>"Marian!" she cried; "my mother's
cousin, Marian."</p>

<p>"You remember me, dear Anne."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you went to India," murmured
Anne in a maze; "I thought&mdash;mother
talked of you to us children&mdash;your
portrait in the school-room&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I went to the Indies; I died there
when you were a little child. You were
always much in my mind, for I loved your
mother, and you were her favorite. So
she did not allow my name to be forgotten?
She talked of me to her children,
and she kept my portrait."</p>

<p>"Did you say&mdash;died!" repeated Anne,
who had given an involuntary start at the
word. "I wonder if I am really meeting
your spirit in a dream? It might be.
Why should it not?"</p>

<p>"You certainly are meeting my spirit,
which is myself, but not in a dream,
dear."</p>

<p>Anne felt a thrill of terror. What if this
were not a dream? "<i>I</i> am not dead?"
She looked at Marian with frightened,
questioning eyes.</p>

<p>"You must be dead," was the answer,
"else how should you be here? Your
mother used to write me that you had unusual
powers; I never had. You might,
as a mortal, possibly see me, but I could
not be conscious of you unless you were
as real as myself."</p>

<p>Anne stared hard at her companion.
"I have, it is true," said she, "imagined
I saw spirits, but they were not like you;
they were phantoms, ghosts, immaterial."
She hesitated, and then took Marian's
hand in hers. "This hand is as solid as
my own. If I believed you were dead&mdash;if
I thought I was&mdash;dead&mdash;myself, oh, it
would be appalling!"</p>

<p>"My dear Anne," said Marian, "we
are both spirits; we were always spirits,
only in the body we were chained spirits.
Material or immaterial only means a point
of view, not a difference."</p>

<p>"I am no spirit," said Anne. "I am of
the earth, and the flesh; all my thoughts
are with, and on the earth, and of the
earth. As to you, Marian, I don't know.
There is an uncertainty in my mind&mdash;no,
I mean an enlightenment; I don't know
what to call it&mdash;an apprehension. Marian,
do you mind? I thought heaven
was a very different place. I should expect
something more serious, more solemn.
The idea of an everlasting sabbath
used to depress me. I have no desire
for such a state&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heaven! Heaven! Did you think
you were in heaven? Oh, no, this is not
heaven. I trust there may be a heaven,
and a future life, but this is not heaven.
I only <i>know</i> about this world in which I
exist, and that it is immeasurably better
than that other world we have both happily
left."</p>

<p>"It is all so different from one's dreams,"
said Anne. "Dreams," she repeated;
"dreams. Marian, did you long for those
you left behind? Were you lonely without
them? Or were you with them, following
all their affairs with sympathy and understanding?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Marian, "I knew no more
of my loved ones in the past life than
they knew of me. That is the worst of
it, both now and before; the separation,
the waiting. I wish I had had more faith
in the old days. I wish my faith were
greater now. My dearest ones left me
when I was no more than thirty, and I
was eighty when I died. It was a long
waiting. You were a little child, then,
and you must have been well in years
when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, don't!" cried Anne; "don't
repeat that dreadful word! I am not, I
cannot be! And yet I know, and hate
the knowledge, that it must come to me
very soon, for I am, as you say, an old
woman. Let me enjoy this beautiful
dream wherein I am still young. But is
this youth? When I look at you, Marian,
you are not old, but you are not young.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
My intellect will not conceive it what it
is."</p>

<p>"If you would only believe me," said
Marian, "that we are both relieved of the
burden of the flesh with all its infirmities
and limitations. It is that, only that.
There can be no pain where there is no
flesh to suffer."</p>

<p>"And no sorrow?" asked Anne.</p>

<p>"Sorrow," replied Marian, "that is of
the mind, and the mind is part of ourselves."</p>

<p>"Separation is the worst," replied Anne.
"Separation." "Suppose," she thought,
"that I am really in another existence,
where then is my dear, old John, my husband?"</p>

<p>"Marian," she cried out, "I must go
home; at once!"</p>

<p>"But my dear," said Marian, "you
cannot; as a mortal you could not come
here; how then can you now go there?
Oh, Anne, there are many loved ones waiting
for you here. Many who loved you.
We knew you would arrive suddenly; we
were warned of that; I came first&mdash;it was
thought best&mdash;to prepare you for the great
meeting."</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Anne, sharply, "I am
going home. John will miss me. I have
been too long away already."</p>

<p>"Your mother, Anne, she is coming,"
pleaded Marian.</p>

<p>"Not mother, nor father, nor friends
beloved can come between John and me.
I must see John first. Something may
have happened."</p>

<p>She looked about her. "I don't quite
know where I am. There should be people
about. I see no one to put me on
the road."</p>

<p>"Anne," said Marian, "neither you nor
I can find that road."</p>

<p>"Oh, come with me," cried Anne, "help
me to find John; I must find John."</p>

<p>The two women moved together hand
in hand down the hill into the valley.</p>

<p>"I can make out nothing in this bewildering
fog," said Anne, peering out from
under her hand. "Whenever I seem just
about to recognize a familiar place or object,
it is to be blotted out by the fog.
There was no fog before. Oh, Marian, it
should be hereabouts; our house should
be here!"</p>

<p>Marian withdrew her hand from Anne's.</p>

<p>"You disturb me," she said; "what
you are doing is unlawful. Come away;
something mortal might appear. If you
will not, Anne, you drive me from you;
I dare not stay."</p>

<p>Anne stood alone, trying to pierce with
her gaze the fog which grew perceptibly
thinner. The elm, and then the shrubbery
of her garden began to show darkly,
like shadows. She drew closer, for now
the house itself loomed up, large and imposing,
but in some intangible way different.
The walls, the doors, the windows,
all were there, all in their appointed places.
What, then, was the indefinable change?
It used to be considered such a pleasant
house, so cheerful, so gay with its hanging
creepers, and the bright curtains at the
windows. Two years running a bird had
nested in the cornice over the porch. But
to-day it presented an aspect of gloom
that was forbidding in the extreme. It
gave the impression of a house to be
avoided, a place where wrong things had
happened, or might happen. Anne, now
that she was so near that a word spoken
aloud would reach her husband's ear, and
she had only to lift the knocker and enter
her own door, shrank back with an odd
reluctance. She would walk round to the
study first, and look through the window.
Perhaps John would be there, reading, or
writing a letter, and, without doubt, wondering
what had become of his wife. The
blinds were closed. How like John not
to think of opening them. With all the
blinds down like that, people would think
there was a death&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>John was sitting by the table, leaning
forward, apparently asleep. He was so
still, so quiet. Oh, if anything had happened
to John! No; he raised his head as though
he heard someone call, looking straight
in his wife's eyes. Why did he not speak?
What ailed him to look like that? Anne
remembered that she was behind the closed
blinds. His eyes had a strained look as
though he almost saw her.</p>

<p>"John! John!" she cried.</p>

<p>The old man shivered and looked vaguely
round him. Anne noticed that he had
no fire. The hoar-frost of the morning,
that looked so beautiful, he would feel that;
he was very sensitive to changes of temperature
and weather. His clothes, too,
looked thinner than he was in the habit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
of wearing&mdash;and with a great black patch
on one sleeve! Anne must see to this at
once. John was less fit than ever to take
care of himself. He looked so feeble, so
old, so much older than she had thought.
Ah, what would John do without her?
Her heart yearned over him with the tender
compassion of the strong for the weak,
the deep affection that belongs to the habit
of a lifetime&mdash;stronger than the love of
youth.</p>

<p>"John, John, my husband!"</p>

<p>Again he turned his face toward the
window, a leaden gray face. Slow tears
ran down his furrowed cheeks and fell on
his breast.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it? Oh, my poor old husband!"</p>

<p>Anne flew to the closed door and
snatched at the knocker. Her hands
closed on vacancy. Her own house, her
home, John's home, and she could not get
in! Back she ran to the window. He
was still there, his head lying on his clenched
hands. As though from a long distance,
thin and faint, his voice came to Anne,
broken with weeping. He was calling on
her name&mdash;"<i>Anne, Anne!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear old husband, do you miss
me so sorely? John, John, open the window
and let me in!"</p>

<p>He moved, as though in answer, but
sank back again with a weary shake of his
head. Anne lifted her arms and struck
at the wall. That it should prove "such
stuff as dreams are made on" gave her no
surprise. She was beside John; nothing
else was of importance. A shadowy serving-maid
opened a door, looked wildly
round, shuddered, and fled. John seemed
conscious of her presence; oh, why not,
then, of Anne's?</p>

<p>She knelt beside him, she laid her hands
on his, she murmured all the foolish endearing
phrases that were their own; but
he saw nothing, he heard nothing.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear old husband," she said;
"husband of my youth and of my old age;
we are one; we cannot be parted. I
will not leave you. I shall wait beside
you."</p>

<p>John turned with seeing eyes. "<i>Anne!</i>"
he cried, with a loud voice, as his head fell
on her breast.</p>

<p>Together they passed out of the house,
paying no heed to what was left behind,
nor to the terrified call of the serving-maid,
"Help, help, master is dead!"</p>

<h2>THE POINT OF VIEW</h2>

<p>It is more than a full generation, it is going
on for half a century, since Thackeray,
lecturing on Charity and Honor,
in New York, paid the street-manners of the
city the pretty compliment that all readers
ought to remember:</p>

<div class="sidenote">American Urbanities</div>

<p class="blockquot">
I will tell you when I have been
put in mind of the courteous gallantry of the noble
knight, Sir Roger de Coverley, of Coverley Manor,
of the noble Hidalgo Don Quixote of la Mancha:
here, in your own omnibus-carriages and railway-cars,
when I have seen a woman step in, handsome
or not, well-dressed or not, and a workman in hob-nailed
shoes, or a dandy in the height of the fashion,
rise up and give her his place.</p>

<p>"Omnibus-carriages" have given way altogether
to the horse-car; and the horse-car
has ceded to the elevated train, to the cable-car,
to the under-ground trolley. These vehicles
subsist, but in what one of them could
the admiring tourist see repeated as a rule
what was, without question, the rule in 1852?</p>

<p>"The age of chivalry is gone" from the
public conveyances of New York. Apparently
it has gone farther from New York than
from any other American city. At least that
is the conclusion to which a New Yorker is
reluctantly driven who has occasion to visit
other American cities. The boorishness of
New York is now what impresses the British
tourist. Stevenson made his first appearance
in New York a matter of seventeen years
after Thackeray's last appearance, and he in
turn recorded his observation. It was that
he was received in casual places where he
was personally unknown with a surprising
mixture of "rudeness and kindness." But
what struck him first, struck him in the face,
so to say, was the rudeness. The healing
kindness came after, and the final conclusion
was that New Yorkers (he was careful not to
say Americans) were well-meaning and kind-hearted
people who had no manners. The
good intentions and the kind hearts may be
questioned by any spectator of the scramble
at a station of any one of the elevated roads
during the crowded hours, where male creatures
may be seen using the superior strength
of their sex to arrive at seats in advance of
women. Even where this is not put too
grossly in evidence, it is plain to the spectator
of the scramble that the age of chivalry
is gone.</p>

<p>The travelling New Yorker becomes aware
that this is largely local. A Southern newspaper
man, writing from New York to his
paper, not long ago, noted its manners with
even a touch of horror. "When I saw a
man sitting in a car in which a woman was
standing," he says, "I knew that I was far
from home." A very recent British observer,
the clever author of "The Land of The Dollar,"
proceeding from New York to Philadelphia,
recorded his refreshment at happening
upon an American town where the inhabitants
were not too busy, when the stranger
thanked them for a piece of information, to
answer "You're very welcome."</p>

<p>When the New Yorker goes abroad at
home, he finds unwelcome confirmation of
the suggestion that his own city is the most
unmannerly of all. The New Englander has
undoubtedly a way, as Anthony Trollope
noted, of giving you a piece of information
as if he were making you a present of a dollar.
But for all that, the sensitive stranger
finds himself much less rasped at the end of
a day in Boston, than at the end of a day
in New York. As you go Southward, the
level of manners rises in proportion almost
to the respective stages of social culture
reached in the colonial times, when Josiah
Quincy found in Charleston a degree of
"civility" and "elegance" such as the good
Bostonian recorded that he had never seen,
nor expected to see, on this side of the Atlantic.
One is driven, in view of the Southern
courtesy, to wonder whether there may
not be something in Goethe's defence of the
duello, to the effect that it is more desirable
that there should be some security in the
community against a rude act than that all
men should be secure of dying in their beds.</p>

<p>But this explanation does not account for
the fact that in whatever direction the New
Yorker goes from home he finds better manners
of the road, manners of the street-car,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
manners of the elevator, than those he left.
Western cities, unless they be Southwestern
also, have not the soothing softness and deference
of Southern manners, but there is in
these a recognition on the part of the human
brother whom you casually encounter, of
your human brotherhood which you are by
no means so sure of eliciting from the casual
and promiscuous New Yorker. The Chicagoan
will tell you in detail what you want to
know, even though, as Mr. Julian Ralph has
remarked, he makes you trot alongside of
him on the sidewalk while he is telling it.
And in an elevator in which there is a woman,
the Chicagoan hats are as promptly
and automatically doffed as the Bostonese,
while in this regard it is New York and not
Philadelphia that is the Quaker city.</p>

<p>"Ethnic" explanations of the bad manners
of New York will occur to many readers,
which "it may be interesting not to state."
These mostly fall to the ground before the
appalling fact that Chicago is better-mannered.
The elevated roads are great demoralizers.
It is barely that primitive human
decency escapes from the "Sauve qui peut"
and "Devil take the hindmost" of that
mode of transit, to say nothing of the fine
flower of courtesy. Let us hope it is all the
doing of the elevated roads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Public Manners of Women</div>

<p>It is painful to have to say that inquiry
among males for an explanation of the degeneration
just mentioned reveals yet another
lamentable decline in chivalry. For it
is a fact that the current masculine hypothesis
attributes it to the women themselves.
This is a reversion to a
state of things which prevailed long
before the age of chivalry had come. The
scandalous behavior of Adam, in devolving
upon the partner and fragment of his bosom
the responsibility for his indulgence in the
"<i>malum prohibitum</i>" of Eden, has been frequently
cited in assemblages of Woman in
proof of the innate and essential unchivalrousness
of Man. It is there regarded as, to
say the least of it, real mean.</p>

<p>The citation may not appear germane to
an appeal for merely equal rights, which is
the professed object of the "woman-women,"
but it is surely pertinent to the male contention
that woman would get more by throwing
herself upon the mercy of man than by appealing
to his justice. If we take a more
modern view of the origin of the relations of
the sexes, it is evident that only that minimum
of courtly consideration for the weaker vessel
which was needful for the preservation of the
species was to be expected from a gentleman
whose habits had only just ceased to be arboreal,
and that the age of chivalry must have
been a very long time in coming.</p>

<p>It is, all the same, a fact that, when a son of
Adam of the younger generation is asked
how, in a public conveyance, he can retain
both his seat and his equanimity while a
daughter of Eve is standing, he is apt to recur
to the third chapter of Genesis, and to
put the blame on "the woman thou gavest to
be with me." "You don't even get thanked
for it," he will say. His father, and much
more his grandfather, would have been
ashamed to offer that excuse. It would have
been ruled out as invalid, even if accurate;
and the heir of all the ages who makes it does
not put it to the proof often enough to know
whether it is accurate or not.</p>

<p>But it must be owned that there is too
much truth in it. Woman's inhumanity to
man is a good deal in evidence. The late
Senator Morton, of Indiana, was, it will be remembered,
an invalid and a cripple. He came
into a company at the capital one day in a
state of great indignation because, in a street-car
crowded with young women, not one had
offered him a seat, and he had been compelled
to make the journey painfully and precariously
supported upon his crutches. The
like of this may very often be seen. Humanity,
consideration for weakness and helplessness,
is the root of which chivalry is the fine
flower. The Senator's experience was not
unique, was not even exceptional. It is a
startling proposition that man's inhumanity
to man is less than woman's, but the time
seems to give it some proof. At any rate, a
man evidently disabled would not be allowed
to stand in a public conveyance in which
able-bodied men were seated, even in the
most unchivalrous part of our country, which
I have given some reasons for believing to
be the city of New York. And, if that be
true, it seems that the assumption of the
right of an able-bodied woman to remain
seated while a disabled man is standing is an
assumption that the claims of chivalry are superior
to those of humanity. On the other
hand, it may fairly be said that the selfishness
of women with regard to the wayfaring man
is more thoughtless and perfunctory than the
selfishness of men with regard to the wayfaring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
woman. In this country, at least, this
latter is in all cases felt to be a violation of
propriety and decency. The native American
feels himself to be both on his defence
and without defence, when he is arraigned
for it. This was illustrated one day in a car
of the New York elevated road, in which a
middle-aged woman was standing in front of
a young man who was sitting. Fixing him
with her glittering eye, she said, calmly but
firmly, "Get up, young man, I want that
seat." The conscience-stricken youth rose
meekly and automatically at the summons,
and left his seat the spoil of the Amazonian
bow and spear.</p>

<p>However it may be with woman's inhumanity
to man, there can be no question
about her inhumanity to woman. It does
"make countless thousands mourn." And
this not alone in the familiar sense in which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Every fault a tear may claim,</p>
<p>Except an erring sister's shame.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whatever male has assisted at a function at
which males are not supposed to assist, and
at which the admixture of males is so small as
to be negligible, has seen sights as astonishing
in their way as the sights witnessed by the
rash males who, at the peril of their lives,
smuggled themselves into those antique mysteries
from which they were expressly excluded.
Nowhere in the gatherings of men does
shameless selfishness find so crude an expression
as, say, at a crowded matinée. It could
not be exhibited at a prize-fight, for the exhibitor
would subject himself to prompt personal
assault. But the female bully is without
fear as without shame. She elbows her
way through and past her timid sisters, takes
tranquil possession of the standing-places
they have reserved by occupation, and scatters
them to flight as the fierce hawk the pavid
doves. Of course the bullies are a small minority,
but one hawk suffices to flutter the most
populous dove-cote, and to characterize the
assemblage which it dominates. The young
man who excuses his own bad manners by
blaming "the woman" only emphasizes his
want of chivalry; but the validity of his plea
is more deniable than its accuracy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The English Voice on the American Stage</div>

<p>In the play of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," made
out of Mark Twain's book by Frank
Mayo, the evil genius combines in his
veins the bad blood and craven instincts of
two races. The <i>rôle</i> was given, when first
presented, a remarkable impersonation in
which there was a subtle mingling of a white
man's presumption and a negro's
animalism. But the creator of the
part was the brother of a leading
English poet! An American actor
essayed the <i>rôle</i> in the second season with
decidedly less success. In "The Heart of
Maryland," a strenuous developing of Civil
War emotions and events, the fate of the
hero, a soldier whose devotion to the North
alienates him from father and sweetheart, was
given in both its first two seasons to actors
of good schooling indeed, but distinctly English.
The "leading juvenile," supposedly a
Confederate officer with all a Southron's
manner of speech, was also most pronouncedly
a Briton in tongue, build, and carriage.
In that exciting coil about a lovable spy&mdash;"Secret
Service"&mdash;not exactly the villain,
but the chief meddler with the hero's plans,
was on the programme a Virginia gentleman,
but on the stage entirely British.</p>

<p>Multiplying examples is unnecessary; there
is enough food for reflection in these three
recent plays. They are all marked with particular
Americanism, and a prominent share
of that Americanism is entrusted to actors
foreign-born and foreign-bred.</p>

<p>We are so used here to accepting certain
mannerisms of speech as indigenous to, and
proper to, the theatre, and so many of our
actors follow British pronunciation and inflection,
that we hardly see the extent to which
the natively English voice prevails on our
stage. Once the thing gets on one's nerves,
however, it is most noticeable. Indeed, the
presence of English actors on the American
stage is so pervasive of everything, from
farce-comedy to society-tragedy, that they
fairly invest our national drama.</p>

<p>Now of all insularities the most abominable,
the one most to be shunned by this
country is artistic insularity. It is an excellent
cosmopolitanism that gives our patronage
so generously to the greatest foreign
stars, although it is bald snobbery that often
leads us to favor mediocre importations over
native genius. But it is surely carrying our
worldliness too far when we accept and approve
the hopeless incapacity of foreigners to
enact <i>rôles</i> demanding American local color.
This may substantiate our proverbial patience,
but it deals hard with our boasted
sense of the incongruous. So much have
unlike environments in a hundred years differentiated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the two races that an English impersonation
of an American character can
never be acceptable to real criticism.</p>

<p>The reason for the sway of English actors
over our stage is not far to seek. It is not
that the best of them can act better than our
best, for we have in our little day produced a
very few of the greatest actors, tragic and
comic. And we still have an excellent array
of the plebs of the stage. It is the middle
class&mdash;which is ever the grand average and
backbone of any organization&mdash;that is not
satisfactory and must draw on foreign aid.
The average middle-class actor in England
supplies the demand, for he is far above our
similar caste in training and finish, and for
good reason. In England the stage is taken
more seriously than here, at least by the
players. There an actor enters upon his
career with the same desire for the thoroughness
that comes from humble beginnings and
complete experience as anyone entering upon
any other profession. He may cherish vague
hopes of greatness&mdash;as every American lawyer
hopes to be President&mdash;but he is content
if his lot is cast in respectable places, where
the labor is agreeable and the compensation
decent. The result is an army of thoroughly
drilled actors that can do almost anything
well, though they may do nothing brilliantly.</p>

<p>In the United States, however, where opinion
still maligns the business of the actor, he
is likely to look on his career as a mere trade
or as a too, too high art. Our actor is either
one whose ambitions lead him to hitch his
wagon to a star and scorn all sublunary
things, or one stolidly content to please&mdash;not
the aristocratic groundlings, but the skylings.
Of these two sorts of actor, the former thinks
a legitimate minor part too far beneath him
to justify serious preparation, the latter thinks
it too far above him. There is, consequently,
an inadequate list of native actors sufficiently
prepared in technic to do well anything that
comes to hand. The tendency, too, of an
American actor, having hit upon a success in
one kind of character, to make an exclusive
specialty of it and devote a lifetime to one
range of parts, is both due to the besetting
commercialism of our stage and responsible
for much of its lack of versatility. The manager,
finding no well-equipped, highly adaptable
rank-and-file at home, turns naturally to
the one source of unfailing supply&mdash;England.</p>

<p>In the few stock companies that survive
the old <i>régime</i>, the English voice is particularly
prevalent. For the English origin of
these actors essaying American <i>rôles</i> is discoverable
by the voice almost more than by
the bearing. Though we of the United States
and they of the United Kingdom approximate
considerably in language, we are radically
different in speech. The British actor rather
modifies than accentuates the arpeggios of
Piccadilly, but it is only a long life in America
and a plasticity uncommon in his race
that can disguise him. His curious scale-singing
is an unfailing wonder to the American.
In the American play it can never be
anything but a hopeless incongruity.

<h3><i>ONE WAY OF DESIGNING A MODERN HOUSE</i></h3>

<p>This is set forth in a monograph, the title
of which may be translated and abbreviated
thus: Drawings of the house of
the brothers Bagatti Valsecchi in Milan at
No. 7 Via di Santo Spirito. One very general,
very abstract, very little detailed ground-plan
explains what the house is, considered as a
building occupying a piece of ground, and
doing certain definite work. Evidently it was
thought that more should not be allowed the
public, concerning a house of habitation.
From this it appears that the house is a single
very large dwelling of which the dimensions
on the ground may be taken at one hundred
feet of frontage by sixty feet or rather less of
depth. This, however, is the measurement
of the whole plot of ground; for the house
covers it all, and light for the rearmost rooms
and corridors is obtained by three separate
courts surrounded by arcades. The front on
the street is deeply recessed so as to give a
façade of some fifty-five feet at the bottom of
the court; with two projecting wings of different
widths; the projection, or depth of the
court, being of about eighteen feet. And now
comes the essential thing&mdash;that which forms
the peculiarity of the building, and the immense
and radical diversity between the
scheme proposed by its designer and that
adopted by any Parisian master-workman
who may have a <i>hotel privé</i> to build. The
Milan house is in every respect, in its general
design and in the minutest detail, that which
might have been built about 1475 in the same
town and on the same street. The front is of
brick and terra-cotta, except that the door-piece
in the middle of the recessed façade, the
podium, so to speak, or sub-wall of the basement
story, standing some four feet high, is of
stone; and that a part of one of the wings
where it is opened up in the large doorway
below communicating with a kind of shop
or business-room, and, above, into arcades
with a projecting balcony, is also of cut stone.
This stone would have been taken to be
marble but that the legends expressly speak
of <i>pietra</i>, and it is probable that Istrian or
some other hard white or light gray stone is
used. Of stone also are the pillars which
carry the vaulting of the cloisters, or galleries,
which surround the courts within, and many
pilasters, jamb-pieces, dadoes, parapets, and
balustrades of the interior; as well as the columns
of the <i>logetta</i> which crowns one of the
wings projecting on the street, and a similar
and larger one on the court within. The walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of the courts, except for the stone work above
described and for certain cornice bands which
are evidently of terra-cotta, are entirely finished
in <i>sgraffito</i>; or scratched decoration on
hard plaster, fit to bear the moderate climate of
Milan, together with certain modelling in very
low relief, which is intermingled with the
scratched or incised work, and closely harmonizes
with it. One interesting detail of the
undertaking must be mentioned here: pieces
of ancient work have been built into the structure
rather freely, and these are so perfectly
in the style that they do not attract attention
to themselves. They need, in fact, the legends
which announce their presence. This is one
way of saying that the collected fragments of
antiquity have been carefully chosen with the
view to being of one style, of one epoch, of
one character, and that the building has been
built in the style so fixed. At the principal
doorway there are four ancient medallions of
the character which sculptors of the fifteenth
century enjoyed; that is to say, they are enlargements
of Roman coins. The secondary
or wing doorway, spoken of above as communicating
with what seems to be a kind of shop,
is entirely antique, with pilasters filled with
carving in the sunken panels. In the spandrels
of the arch above are two more antique
medallions, and an antique pilaster in marble
from Mantua is set in the small reëntrant angle
formed between this piece of the front and
the adjoining house, which projects slightly
beyond the Casa Bagatti. Ancient iron work
is used for the two windows which flank the
central doorway, and by way of emphasis
the other windows on that story are without
grilles. Iron work in the head of the side
doorway already described as antique is announced
as made up of ancient parts; and it
may be admitted here that all this wrought
iron is of somewhat earlier date than the
structure generally; a breach of that harmony
which has been insisted on above, but one
which might easily be considered as quite
characteristic of good, fine, imaginative fifteenth
century work, when the Renaissance
builders would have rejected carvings in the
Gothic spirit, but would have admitted iron
work of that character without trouble. Above
this ancient doorway an ancient Venetian
balcony, also of stone, is worked into the
double arcade, of which mention has been
made. Two large and elaborate wooden
ceilings are used in the open cloisters which
surround the courts, and it is worthy of commendation
that they seem to have been put in
place without restoration, with nothing more
than necessary repairs or necessary strengthening,
and that no attempt has been made
to give them a freshly finished modern look.
An ancient doorway of carved wood opens upon
one of these porticoes; an ancient <i>vera di
pozzo</i>, or cistern head, from Venice stands in
the middle of that court; an ancient marble
fountain and basin; an ancient triple tabernacle
with sculptured figures of saints; another
tabernacle with an Adoration, and a
multiplicity of minor pieces of carving, are
worked into the building, including an admirable
lion, of heraldic character and supporting
a shield of arms, set upon a newel at the foot
of the great staircase; and, finally, a very
great amount of ancient ironwork in the way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
of hinges, door-handles, knockers, awning-rings,
and the like, is used in the work.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="caption">Graffito: the Certosa near Pavia. Unfinished; from an Old Picture.</p>
</div>

<p>The use of this ancient material suggests
the true solution of the difficulty which every
one must feel; how such a thing as this can
be fine when we generally find such imitative
work rather mean, rather lazy, rather expressive
of the disposition to shirk one's duty than
a thing to be commended. It might be objected
in the first place that here evidently
there has been no reluctance to undertake
hard work, for the fitting of old and new details
into the same general design, while the
character of the old decoration has not been
marred in the least, is difficult work enough
for any workman. This, however, it is not
necessary to urge.
The essential thing in
the whole situation is
this: The reproduction of the fifteenth
century house is practicable
where the real
fifteenth century house
might have stood. In
Milan, on a quiet by-street
of the old city,
we can imagine this
house having
remained intact and unaltered
from some
time in the second
half of the fifteenth
century until now.
Had any family been
rich enough and possessed
of the spirit of
continuity, that building
would have been
so preserved. The
climate allows of it;
the habits of the people
would make it
easy; one family, or,
as perhaps in this
case, the families of
two brothers, may inhabit
such a mansion,
and might have inhabited
it at any time from
1575 onward for three
hundred years. Moreover,
there is no time
when such a house
might not have been
built. At least, if we
admit that the artists of earlier days were incapable
of deliberate and faithful copying of
details&mdash;that is all that would separate a house
built on these lines in the eighteenth century
from this one of to-day. The traditions have
remained, the masons have worked on these
lines, the stone-cutters have wielded the chisel
just as their forefathers did before them; nothing
but a deliberate resolve to call into prominence
the traditional knowledge and the traditional
habits which have lingered among the
workmen has been necessary in order to call
into existence this memory of the past.</p>

<p class="caption">Largest Inner Court with Graffiti; Vestibule with Ancient Wooden Ceiling.</p>
</div>

<p>You could not build in that way in another
country. This house on the streets of Paris
would have been an absurdity. In Milan it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
represents the wholesome feeling of national
and local sentiment, family pride perhaps, a
sense of what is fitting, a sense of continuity,
all that is noble and dignified in the sentimental
or theoretical side of fine art&mdash;it is this
and nothing worse or lower than this which
has directed this interesting piece of work.
In France, as we have said, and still more
strongly in the United States, such a piece of
work would have been a mere <i>tour de force</i>,
a mere piece of deliberate copying, and, still
more, a deliberate avoidance of the critical
problem&mdash;how to plan and build an American
city house. In north Italy it is the legitimate
and wholly sensible scheme of building an
old-fashioned Milanese house to serve new
Milanese purposes&mdash;and anyone may respect
and sympathize with such an undertaking as
that.</p>
